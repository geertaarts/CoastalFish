abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Signer et al. Habitat-selection analyses are often used to link environmental covariates, measured within some spatial domain of assumed availability, to animal location data that are assumed to be independent. Step-selection functions (SSFs) relax this independence assumption, by using a conditional model that explicitly acknowledges the spatiotemporal dynamics of the availability domain and hence the temporal dependence among successive locations. However, it is not clear how to produce an SSF-based map of the expected utilization distribution. Here, we used SSFs to analyze virtual animal movement data generated at a fine spatiotemporal scale and then rarefied to emulate realistic telemetry data. We then compared two different approaches for generating maps from the estimated regression coefficients. First, we considered a na€ive approach that used the coefficients as if they were obtained by fitting an unconditional model. Second, we explored a simulation-based approach, where maps were generated using stochastic simulations of the parameterized step-selection process. We found that the simulation-based approach always outperformed the na€ive mapping approach and that the latter overestimated home-range size and underestimated local space-use variability. Differences between the approaches were greatest for complex landscapes and high sampling rates, suggesting that the simulation-based approach, despite its added complexity, is likely to offer significant advantages when applying SSFs to real data.},

GPS and other technologies enable detailed tracking of animal location concurrently with acquisition of landscape data and information on individual physiology. These tools can be used to refine our understanding of the mechanistic links between behaviour and individual condition through 'spatially informed' movement models where time allocation to different behaviours affects individual survival and reproduction. For some species, socially informed models that address the movements and average fitness of differently sized groups and how they are affected by fission-fusion processes at relevant temporal scales are required. Furthermore, as most animals revisit some places and avoid others based on their previous experiences, we foresee the incorporation of long-term memory and intention in movement models. The way animals move has important consequences for the degree of mixing that we expect to find both within a population and between individuals of different species. The mixing rate dictates the level of detail required by models to capture the influence of heterogeneity and the dynamics of intra- and interspecific interaction.},

  abstract      = {Summary: The annual cycle of many animals is characterized by the need to satisfy different life history priorities, often requiring seasonal movements. For such species, investigating carry-over effects (such as the year-long drivers of breeding success) and managing protected areas effectively, relies on quantifying these movements. Here, we model the seasonal movements of the UK population of grey seals Halichoerus grypus and show how insights from the model can improve its management. We fit a hidden process model to two types of information - regional population redistribution and individual movements - to estimate the seasonal transition probabilities of breeding female grey seals among four regions around the UK. We found that between 21{\%} and 58{\%} of females used different regions for breeding and foraging. For our study period, we detected an increase in the breeding performance of animals that foraged in the Hebrides and South-East Coast. Grey seal Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) were designed to encompass a significant proportion of the UK breeding population: ̃40{\%} of the breeding females in our study area. Of the females breeding on SACs, only 15{\%} breed in Northern Scotland, but up to 50{\%} forage there. Our results indicate that, by only considering the breeding distribution of females that breed in SACs, the impact of anthropogenic activities on nearby SACs may be overestimated, whereas impacts on remote SACs may be underestimated. Synthesis and applications. By quantifying the link between the foraging and breeding distributions of grey seals, management of breeding populations can be focused on the foraging regions where the resources necessary for reproduction are acquired. The construction of marine developments is dependent on demonstrating that they will not have an adverse effect on the integrity of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), and we have shown that this requires consideration of the seasonal transition probabilities estimated in this study. Our specific results provide support for management strategies that jointly consider SACs and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). More generally, we prescribe combinations of data on population size, breeding performance and individual movement that can enable our framework to be applied to seasonally migrating species.

  abstract      = {Recent technological advances have permitted the collection of detailed animal location and ancillary biotelemetry data that facilitate inference about animal movement and associated behaviors. However, these rich sources of individual information, location, and biotelemetry data, are typically analyzed independently, with population-level inferences remaining largely post hoc. We describe a hierarchical modeling approach, which is able to integrate location and ancillary biotelemetry (e. g., physiological or accelerometer) data from many individuals. We can thus obtain robust estimates of (1) population-level movement parameters and (2) activity budgets for a set of behaviors among which animals transition as they respond to changes in their internal and external environment. Measurement error and missing data are easily accommodated using a state-space formulation of the proposed hierarchical model. Using Bayesian analysis methods, we demonstrate our modeling approach with location and dive activity data from 17 harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in the United Kingdom. Based jointly on movement and diving activity, we identified three distinct movement behavior states: resting, foraging, and transit, and estimated population-level activity budgets to these three states. Because harbor seals are known to dive for both foraging and transit (but not usually for resting), we compared these results to a similar population-level analysis utilizing only location data. We found that a large proportion of time steps were mischaracterized when behavior states were inferred from horizontal trajectory alone, with 33{\%} of time steps exhibiting a majority of dive activity assigned to the resting state. Only 1{\%} of these time steps were assigned to resting when inferred from both trajectory and dive activity data using our integrated modeling approach. There is mounting evidence of the potential perils of inferring animal behavior based on trajectory alone, but there fortunately now exist many flexible analytical techniques for extracting more out of the increasing wealth of information afforded by recent advances in biologging technology.},

  abstract      = {Although classical ecological theory (e.g., on ideal free consumers) recognizes the potential effect of population density on the spatial distribution of animals, empirical species distribution models assume that species–habitat relationships remain unchanged across a range of population sizes. Conversely, even though ecological models and experiments have demonstrated the importance of spatial heterogeneity for the rate of population change, we still have no practical method for making the connection between the makeup of real environments, the expected distribution and fitness of their occupants, and the long-term implications of fitness for population growth. Here, we synthesize several conceptual advances into a mathematical framework using a measure of fitness to link habitat availability/selection to (density-dependent) population growth in mobile animal species. A key feature of this approach is that it distinguishes between apparent habitat suitability and the true, underlying contribution of a habitat to fitness, allowing the statistical coefficients of both to be estimated from multiple observation instances of the species in different environments and stages of numerical growth. Hence, it leverages data from both historical population time series and snapshots of species distribution to predict population performance under environmental change. We propose this framework as a foundation for building more realistic connections between a population's use of space and its subsequent dynamics (and hence a contribution to the ongoing efforts to estimate a species' critical habitat and fundamental niche). We therefore detail its associated definitions and simplifying assumptions, because they point to the framework's future extensions. We show how the model can be fit to data on species distributions and population dynamics, using standard statistical methods, and we illustrate its application with an individual-based simulation. When contrasted with nonspatial population models, our approach is better at fitting and predicting population growth rates and carrying capacities. Our approach can be generalized to include a diverse range of biological considerations. We discuss these possible extensions and applications to real data.},

However, data that can produce predictions with the desired precision are difficult to collect, especially for species with spatially extensive and dynamic distributions. Data from platforms of opportunity could be used to complement or help design dedicated surveys, but robust inference from such data is challenging. Furthermore, regression models using static covariates may not be sufficient for animals whose habitat preferences change dynamically with season, environmental conditions or foraging strategy. More flexible models introduce difficulties in selecting parsimonious models. We implemented a robust model-averaging framework to dy - namically predict harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena occurrence in a strongly tidal and topographically complex site in southwest Wales using data from a temporally intensive platform of opportunity. Spatial and temporal environmental variables were allowed to interact in a generalized additive model (GAM). We used information criteria to examine an extensive set of 3003 models and average predictions from the best 33. In the best model, 3 main effects and 2 tensorproduct interactions explained 46{\%} of the deviance. Model-averaged predictions indicated that harbour porpoises avoided or selected steeper slopes depending on the tidal flow conditions; when the tide started to ebb, occurrence was predicted to increase 3-fold at steeper slopes.},

Recent advancements address issues such as temporal autocorrelation and telemetry measurement error, but additional challenges remain. Difficulties introduced by complicated error structures or barriers to animal movement can weaken inference. We propose an approach for obtaining resource selection inference from animal location data that accounts for complicated error structures, movement constraints, and temporally autocorrelated observations. We specify a model for telemetry data observed with error conditional on unobserved true locations that reflects prior knowledge about constraints in the animal movement process. The observed telemetry data are modeled using a flexible distribution that accommodates extreme errors and complicated error structures. Although constraints to movement are often viewed as a nuisance, we use constraints to simultaneously estimate and account for telemetry error. We apply the model to simulated data, showing that it outperforms common ad hoc approaches used when confronted with measurement error and movement constraints. We then apply our framework to an Argos satellite telemetry data set on harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in the Gulf of Alaska, a species that is constrained to move within the marine environment and adjacent coastlines.},

  abstract      = {1. Resource selection functions (RSFs) are becoming a dominant tool in habitat selection studies. RSF coefficients can be estimated with unconditional (standard) and conditional logistic regressions. While the advantage of mixed-effects models is recognized for standard logistic regression, mixed conditional logistic regression remains largely overlooked in ecological studies. 2. We demonstrate the significance of mixed conditional logistic regression for habitat selection studies. First, we use spatially explicit models to illustrate how mixed-effects RSFs can be useful in the presence of inter-individual heterogeneity in selection and when the assumption of independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA) is violated. The IIA hypothesis states that the strength of preference for habitat type A over habitat type B does not depend on the other habitat types also available. Secondly, we demonstrate the significance of mixed-effects models to evaluate habitat selection of free-ranging bison Bison bison. 3. When movement rules were homogeneous among individuals and the IIA assumption was respected, fixed-effects RSFs adequately described habitat selection by simulated animals. In situations violating the inter-individual homogeneity and IIA assumptions, however, RSFs were best estimated with mixed-effects regressions, and fixed-effects models could even provide faulty conclusions. 4. Mixed-effects models indicate that bison did not select farmlands, but exhibited strong inter-individual variations in their response to farmlands. Less than half of the bison preferred farmlands over forests. Conversely, the fixed-effect model simply suggested an overall selection for farmlands. 5. Conditional logistic regression is recognized as a powerful approach to evaluate habitat selection when resource availability changes. This regression is increasingly used in ecological studies, but almost exclusively in the context of fixed-effects models. Fitness maximization can imply differences in trade-offs among individuals, which can yield inter-individual differences in selection and lead to departure from IIA. These situations are best modelled with mixed-effects models. Mixed-effects conditional logistic regression should become a valuable tool for ecological research.},

Nonetheless, predicting the impacts of novel interactions is challenging, partly because many methods of inference are contingent on the current configuration of climatic variables and species distributions. Focusing on competition, we argue that experiments designed to quantify novel interactions in ways that can inform species distribution models are urgently needed, and suggest an empirical agenda to pursue this goal, illustrated using plants. An emerging convergence of ideas from macroecology and demographically focused competition theory offers opportunities to mechanistically incorporate competition into species distribution models, while forging closer ties between experimental ecology and macroecology.},

  abstract      = {Applications of logistic regression in a used–unused design in wildlife habitat studies often suffer from asymmetry of errors: used resource units (landscape locations) are known with certainty, whereas unused resource units might be observed to be used with greater sampling intensity. More appropriate might be to use logistic regression to estimate a resource selection function (RSF) tied to a use–availability design based on independent samples drawn from used and available resource units. We review the theoretical motivation for RSFs and show that sample ‘‘contamination'' and the exponential form commonly assumed for the RSF are not concerns, contrary to recent statements by Keating and Cherry (2004; Use and interpretation of logistic regression in habitat-selection studies. Journal of Wildlife Management 68:774–789). To do this, we re-derive the use–availability likelihood and show that it can be maximized by logistic regression software. We then consider 2 case studies that illustrate our findings. For our first case study, we fit both RSFs and resource selection probability functions (RSPF) to point count data for 4 bird species with varying levels of occurrence among sample blocks. Drawing on our new derivation of the likelihood, we sample available resource units with replacement and assume overlapping distributions of used and available resource units. Irrespective of overlap, we observed approximate proportionality between predictions of a RSF and RSPF. For our second case study, we evaluate the classic use- availability design suggested by Manly et al. (2002), where availability is sampled without replacement, and we systematically introduce contamination to a sample of available units applied to RSFs for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Although contamination appeared to reduce the magnitude of one RSF beta coefficient, change in magnitude exceeded sampling variation only when .20{\%} of the available units were confirmed caribou use locations (i.e., contaminated). These empirically based simulations suggest that previously recommended sampling designs are robust to contamination. We conclude with a new validation method for evaluating predictive performance of a RSF and for assessing if the model deviates from being proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit.

  abstract      = {Resource selection functions (RSFs) are statistical models defined to be proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit. My objective with this review is to identify how RSFs can be used to unravel the influence of scale in habitat selection. In wildlife habitat studies, including radiotelemetry, RSFs can be estimated using a variety of statistical methods, all of which can be used to explore the role of scale. All RSFs are bounded by the resolution of data and the spatial extent of the study area, but also allow predictor covariates to be measured at a variety of scales. Conditional logistic regression permits designs (e.g. matched case) that relate the process of habitat selection to a limited domain of resource units that might better characterize what is truly ‘available' to the animal. Scale influences the process of habitat selection, e.g. food resources are often selected at fine spatial scales, whereas landscape patterns at much larger scales typically influence the location of home ranges. Scale also influences appropriate sampling in many ways: (1) heterogeneity might be obliterated (transmutation) if resolution or grain size is too large, (2) variance of habitat characteristics might be undersampled if extent or domain is too small, (3) timing and duration of observations can influence RSF models, and (d) both spatial and temporal autocorrelations can vary directly with the intensity of sampling. Using RSFs, researchers can examine habitat selection at multiple scales, and predictive models that bridge scales can be estimated. Using Geographical Information Systems, predictor covariates in RSF models can be measured at different scales easily so that the predictive ability of models at alternative spatial and temporal domains can be explored by the investigator. Identification of the scale that best explains the data can be evaluated by comparing alternative models using information-theoretic metrics such as Akaike Information Criteria, and predictive capability of the models can be assessed using k-fold cross validation.},

  abstract      = {“Species distribution modeling” was recently ranked as one of the top five “research fronts” in ecology and the environmental sciences by ISI's Essential Science Indicators (Renner and Warton 2013), reflecting the importance of predicting how species distributions will respond to anthropogenic change. Unfortunately, species distribution models (SDMs) often perform poorly when applied to novel environments. Compounding on this problem is the shortage of methods for evaluating SDMs (hence, we may be getting our predictions wrong and not even know it). Traditional methods for validating SDMs quantify a model's ability to classify locations as used or unused. Instead, we propose to focus on how well SDMs can predict the characteristics of used locations. This subtle shift in viewpoint leads to a more natural and informative evaluation and validation of models across the entire spectrum of SDMs. Through a series of examples, we show how simple graphical methods can help with three fundamental challenges of habitat modeling: identifying missing covariates, non-linearity, and multicollinearity. Identifying habitat characteristics that are not well-predicted by the model can provide insights into variables affecting the distribution of species, suggest appropriate model modifications, and ultimately improve the reliability and generality of conservation and management recommendations.},

  abstract      = {Management and conservation of populations of animals requires information on where they are, why they are there, and where else they could be. These objectives are typically approached by collecting data on the animals' use of space, relating these positional data to prevailing environmental conditions and employing the resulting statistical models to predict usage at other geographical regions. Technical advances in wildlife telemetry have accomplished manifold increases in the amount and quality of available data, creating the need for a statistical framework that can use them to make population-level inferences for habitat preference and space-use. This has been slow-in-coming because wildlife telemetry data are spatio-temporally autocorrelated, often unbalanced, presence-only observations of behaviourally complex animals, responding to a multitude of cross-correlated environmental variables. We review the evolution of regression models for the analysis of space-use and habitat preference and outline the essential features of a framework that emerges naturally from these foundations. This allows us to derive a relationship between usage of points in geographical space and preference of habitats in environmental space. Within this framework, we discuss eight challenges, inherent in the spatial analysis of telemetry data and, for each, we propose solutions that can work in tandem. Specifically, we propose a logistic, mixed-effects approach that uses generalized additive transformations of the environmental covariates and is fitted to a response data-set comprising the telemetry and simulated observations, under a case-control design. We apply this framework to a non-trivial case-study using satellite-tagged grey seals Halichoerus grypus from the east coast of Scotland. We perform model selection by cross-validation and confront our final model's predictions with telemetry data from the same, as well as different, geographical regions. We conclude that, despite the complex behaviour of the study species, flexible empirical models can capture the environmental relationships that shape population distributions.},

At least two approaches have been proposed to generate pseudo-absences; however it is not clear how the number of pseudo-absences created affect model performance. Moreover, the spatial bias in the collecting localities of a species (presence data) may add extra noise to the final distribution model. Here, we use a virtual species to assess the effects of spatial sampling bias, and number and location of pseudo-absences on model accuracy. We found that both number of pseudo-absences and spatial bias in sampling localities, as well as their interaction, significantly influence all accuracy measures (AUC, sensitivity, and specificity). However, location of pseudo-absences (either generated across the entire study area or only outside the environmental envelope of the species) does not affect model performance. These results provide some methodological guidelines for developing reliable distribution hypotheses when presence data are scarce. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier GmbH.},

However, evidence of SDMs supporting solutions for on-ground conservation problems is still scarce in the scientific literature. Here, we show that successful examples exist but are still largely hidden in the grey literature, and thus less accessible for analysis and learning. Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identification of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of decision-making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual use of SDMs to support conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of 'translators' between modellers and decision makers. We encourage species distribution modellers to get involved in real decision-making processes that will benefit from their technical input; this strategy has the potential to better bridge theory and practice, and contribute to improve both scientific knowledge and conservation outcomes.},

A survey was conducted to determine moose resource selection and the effects of human disturbance on moose in a study area of 20,661 ha located on the northwestern slope of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, located in northeastern China. Predictive models of resource selection were developed using logistic and autologistic regression. All models considered resource variable selection at two spatial scales, patch and landscape. At the patch scale, moose preferred larger birch (Betula platyphylla) patches, but avoided larger tamarack (Larix gmelinii) patches. At the landscape scale, moose preferred higher densities of tamarack patches, i.e., heterogeneity of tamarack stands, selected areas with more abundant annual shoots, terrain conducive to better concealment, higher altitudes and areas saturated with soil moisture. Roads and forest harvest intervals were identified as important human disturbance factors. This is the first time that moose have been reported to avoid roads, and the avoidance distance was nearly 3 km. We believe that in this region moose under the influence of roads are behaviorally plastic, compared with the indifference of moose to the presence of roads in other regions. Moose avoided forest areas logged more than 3 years previously and preferred areas logged 1–2 years previously. In addition, it may be necessary to monitor the effect of the dynamic of density of roe deer on the spatial distribution of the moose population.},

  abstract      = {1Resource selection functions (RSF) have contributed to the conservation of species negatively affected by human activities. Despite these applications, two assumptions frequent many studies: the assumption of independence among groups in social species, and that selection is proportional to resource availability. This latter case is known as a functional response in resource selection, and may be especially important in human–wildlife relationships where there is a fitness cost of proximity to humans.2Recent advances in generalized linear mixed models offer new ways to account for resource selection in social species and functional responses by accommodating correlations within hierarchical groups with random intercepts, and functional responses with random coefficients.3We illustrate the application of mixed-effects RSF models using a case study of resource selection by individual wolves Canis lupus living in packs as a function of human activity.4In areas of low human activity, wolf resource selection was independent of proximity to humans. As human activity increased, wolves displayed a functional response selecting areas closer to human activity. With increasing human activity, however, wolves displayed spatio-temporal avoidance of human activity during daylight. This could lead to behaviourally induced trophic cascades mediated by wolf avoidance of human activity, and fits within the framework of attractive sink habitats.5Accounting for the hierarchical social structure of wolves clearly showed that the response of wolves to human disturbance was strongly correlated, but different, within packs, and that the correlation was strongest during winter and weakest during summer.6Syntheses and applications. Failure to consider the social structure of wolves and the functional response to human activity would result in mistaken conclusions about wolf–human relationships. Our approach provides a unifying framework to understand the contradictory results of previous studies of wolf–human relationships and a template for future studies to evaluate effects of increasing human activity on wildlife.},

Hence, deviations from proportionality between use and availability are considered the tell-tale sign of preference. This principle forms the basis for most habitat selection and species distribution models fitted to use-availability or count data (e.g. MaxEnt and Resource Selection Functions). * Yet, once an essential habitat type is sufficiently abundant to meet an individual's needs, increased availability of this habitat type may lead to a decrease in the use/availability ratio. Accordingly, habitat selection functions may estimate negative coefficients when habitats are superabundant, incorrectly suggesting an apparent avoidance. Furthermore, not accounting for the effects of availability on habitat use may lead to poor predictions, particularly when applied to habitats that differ considerably from those for which data have been collected. * Using simulations, we show that habitat use varies non-linearly with habitat availability, even when individuals follow simple movement rules to acquire food and avoid risk. The results show that the impact of availability strongly depends on the type of habitat (e.g. whether it is essential or substitutable) and how it interacts with the distribution and availability of other habitats. * We demonstrate the utility of a variety of existing and new methods that enable the influence of habitat availability to be explicitly estimated. Models that allow for non-linear effects (using b-spline smoothers) and interactions between environmental covariates defining habitats and measures of their availability were best able to capture simulated patterns of habitat use across a range of environments. * An appealing aspect of some of the methods we discuss is that the relative influence of availability is not defined a priori, but directly estimated by the model.

  abstract      = {Species distribution models (SDMs) use spatial environmental data to make inferences on species' range limits and habitat suitability. Conceptually, these models aim to determine and map components of a species' ecological niche through space and time, and they have become important tools in pure and applied ecology and evolutionary biology. Most approaches are correlative in that they statistically link spatial data to species distribution records. An alternative strategy is to explicitly incorporate the mechanistic links between the functional traits of organisms and their environments into SDMs. Here, we review how the principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints. We show how physiologically based SDMs can be developed for different organisms in different environmental contexts. Mechanistic SDMs have different strengths and weaknesses to correlative approaches, and there are many exciting and unexplored prospects for integrating the two approaches. As physiological knowledge becomes better integrated into SDMs, we will make more robust predictions of range shifts in novel or non-equilibrium contexts such as invasions, translocations, climate change and evolutionary shifts.},

  abstract      = {The analysis of telemetry data obtained from tagged animals often requires that a smooth surface of spatial usage is fitted to the observations. Well-established statisti- cal techniques for doing this, such as kernel smoothing (KS), are based on asymptotic arguments that guarantee the convergence of their estimates to the truth with increasing sample size. Often, in addition to telemetry data, ecologists have access to a wealth of information relating to the animals distribution and movement. This additional information is potentially useful for the estimation of spatial usage but currently remains unused by existing methods. In this paper, I outline and begin the validation of model-supervised kernel smoothing (MSKS), a modification of KS that uses such information to supervise surface-fitting to telemetry data. MSKS initially requires an ad-hoc synthesis of all the available information, excluding telemetry, into an auxiliary usage surface (the model). This is then combined with the kernel- smoothed telemetry data into a hybrid surface that is the weighted average of the two. Automatic selection of the smoothing coefficient and the weight associated with the model is done by means of likelihood cross-validation. I examine the performance of MSKS first, by extensive, numerical exploration on simulated data in one-dimen- sional space and second, on two-dimensional data obtained from an individual-based simulation of a central-place forager. The results for different models and sample sizes indicate that MSKS has three important properties. Firstly, it generally outper- forms KS by an extent that depends on the quality of the auxiliary model. Secondly, when the auxiliary model is not informative, MSKS automatically reverts to a similar output as KS. Finally, in practical terms, MSKS is easy to implement and adds little to the computational requirements already made by KS methods. I illustrate the application of MSKS and further validate its performance on satellite telemetry data collected from a grey seal on the east coast of Scotland.},

However, the methods for quantifying resistance surfaces are varied and there is no general consensus on the appropriate choice of environmental data or analytical approaches. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature on this topic to highlight methods used and identify knowledge gaps. Our review includes 96 papers that parameterized resistance surfaces (sometimes using multiple approaches) for a variety of taxa. Data types used included expert opinion (n = 76), detection (n = 23), relocation (n = 8), pathway (n = 2), and genetic (n = 28). We organized the papers into three main analytical approaches; one-stage expert opinion, one-stage empirical, and two-stage empirical, each of which was represented by 43, 22, and 36 papers, respectively. We further organized the empir- ical approaches into five main resource selection functions; point (n = 16), matrix (n = 38), home range (n = 3), step (n = 1), and pathway (n = 1).We found a general lack of justification for choice of environmental variables and their thematic and spatial representation, a heavy reliance on expert opinion and detection data, and a tendency to confound movement behavior and resource use. Future research needs include comparative analyses on the choice of envi- ronmental variables and their spatial and thematic scales, and on the various biological data types used to estimate resistance. Comparative analyses amongst analytical processes is also needed, as well as trans- parency in reporting on uncertainty in parameter estimates and sensitivity of final resistance surfaces, especially if the resistance surfaces are to be used for conservation and planning purposes},

  abstract      = {Resource availability and resource use are 2 key concepts in studies of resource selection. Although equal accessibility to resources is one component defining resource availability, we rarely know what restricts access to resources. Consequently for spatially distributed resources, the animal's use of space in association with the occurrence of resources is a frequent basis for inferring resource use and testing for resource selection. For many resources, occurrence can be defined for the population or the individual animal and requires that researchers specify the spatial extent of resources an animal might use during the time interval of study (e.g., the "choice set"). Often the occurrence of resources is defined at multiple scales, which facilitates understanding hierarchical selection patterns. We discuss numerous factors and criteria that should be considered when delineating the area an animal might use during a period of interest. New analytical approaches to resource selection, including resource utilization functions (RUF) and discrete choice modeling, help address some of the issues of defining availability and dealing with the behaviors associated with resource use. A currency of use is a measure of the investment made by an animal in securing resources, avoiding loss of resources, or otherwise optimizing fitness. Common currencies used by researchers include time spent or distance traveled in a cover type, use of event sites (e.g., nest sites, roosting sites, den sites), or amounts of different kinds of foods consumed. Less common, but potentially highly informative, are such currencies as energy expended or predation risk or other risk incurred. Simulation of animal movements interspersed with diel resting periods, through habitat types with activity-dependent energy expenditure and habitat-specific predation risk showed that choice of a currency of use strongly influences inferences about habitat selection. We argue that perhaps the most informative currency of use would be increased risk to fitness accepted by an animal. Although fairly simple conceptually, such application of risk assessment faces formidable empirical challenges and is a worthy goal for the next generation of researchers of animal resource selection.},

  abstract      = {We propose a general framework for the analysis of animal telemetry data through the use of weighted distributions. It is shown that several interpretations of resource selection functions arise when constructed from the ratio of a use and availability distribution. Through the proposed general framework, several popular resource selection models are shown to be special cases of the general model by making assumptions about animal movement and behavior. The weighted distribution framework is shown to be easily extended to readily account for telemetry data that are highly autocorrelated; as is typical with use of new technology such as global positioning systems animal relocations. An analysis of simulated data using several models constructed within the proposed framework is also presented to illustrate the possible gains from the flexible modeling framework. The proposed model is applied to a brown bear data set from southeast Alaska.},

  abstract      = {We present a correlative modelling technique that uses locality records (associated with species presence) and a set of predictor variables to produce a statistically justifiable probability response surface for a target species. The probability response surface indicates the suitability of each grid cell in a map for the target species in terms of the suite of predictor variables. The technique constructs a hyperspace for the target species using principal component axes derived from a principal com- ponents analysis performed on a training dataset. The training dataset comprises the values of the predictor variables associated with the localities where the species has been recorded as present. The origin of this hyperspace is taken to characterize the centre of the niche of the organism. All the localities (grid-cells) in the map region are then fitted into this hyperspace using the values of the predictor variables at these localities (the prediction dataset). The Euclidean distance from any locality to the origin of the hyperspace gives a measure of the 'centrality' of that locality in the hyperspace. These distances are used to derive probability values for each grid cell in the map region. The modelling technique was applied to bioclimatic data to predict bioclimatic suitability for three alien invasive plant species (Lantana camarcl L., Ricinus communis L, and Solanum mauritianunz Scop.) in South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. The models were tested against independent test records by calculating area under the curve (AUC) values of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and kappa statistics. There was good agreement between the models and the independent test records. The pre-processing of climatic variable data to reduce the deleterious effects of multicollinearity, and the use of stop- ping rules to prevent overfitting of the models are important},

The probability that an individual uses a given resource, as characterized by environmental factors, can be quantified in terms of the resource selection probability function (RSPF). The present literature on the topic has claimed that, except when both used and unused sites are known, the RSPF is non-estimable and that only a function proportional to RSPF, namely, the resource selection function (RSF) can be estimated. This paper describes a close connection between the estimation of the RSPF and the estimation of the weight function in the theory of weighted distributions. This connection can be used to obtain fully efficient, maximum likelihood estimators of the resource selection probability function under commonly used survey designs in wildlife management. The method is illustrated using GPS collar data for mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus de Blainville 1816) in},

  abstract      = {Ecological theory and current evidence support the validity of various species response curves according to a variety of environmental gradients. Various methods have been developed for building species distribution models but it is not well known how these methods perform under various assumptions about the form of the underlying species response. It is also not well known how spatial correlation in species occurrence affects model performance. These effects were investigated by applying an environmental envelope method (BIOCLIM) and three regression-based methods: logistic regression (LR), generalized additive modelling (GAM), and classification and regression tree (CART) to simulated species occurrence data. Each simulated species was constructed as a sum of responses with varying weights. Three basic species response curves were assumed: Gaussian (bell-shaped), Beta (skew) and linear. The two non-linear responses conform to standard ecological niche theory. All three responses were applied in turn to three simulated environmental variables, each with varying degrees of spatial autocorrelation. GAM produced the most consistent model performance over all forms of simulated species response. BIOCLIM and CART were inclined to underrate the performance of variables with a linear response. BIOCLIM was less sensitive to data density. LR was susceptible to model misspecification. The use of a linear function in LR underestimated the performance of variables with non-linear species response and contributed to increased spatial autocorrelation in model residuals. Omission of important environmental variables with non-linear species response also contributed to increased spatial autocorrelation in model residuals. Adding a spatial autocovariate term to the LR model (autologistic model) reduced the spatial autocorrelation and improved model performance, but did not correct the misidentification of the dominant environmental determinant. This is to be expected since the autologistic approach was designed primarily for prediction and not for inference. Given that various forms of species response to environmental determinants arise commonly in nature: (1) higher order functions should always be tested when applying LR in modelling species distribution; (2) spatial autocorrelation in species distribution model residuals can indicate that environmental determinants with non-linear response are missing from the model; and (3) deficiencies in LR model performance due to model misspecification can be addressed by adding a spatial autocovariate to the model, but care should be taken when interpreting the coefficients of the model parameters. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract      = {Most performance criteria which have been applied to train ecological models focus on the accuracy of the model predictions. However, these criteria depend on the prevalence of the training set and often do not take into account ecological issues such as the distinction between omission and commission errors. Moreover, a previous study indicated that model training based on different performance criteria results in different optimised models. Therefore, model developers should train models based on different performance criteria and select the most appropriate model depending on the modelling objective. This paper presents a new approach to train fuzzy models based on an adjustable performance criterion, called the adjusted average deviation (aAD). This criterion was applied to develop a species distribution model for spawning grayling in the Aare River near Thun, Switzerland. To analyse the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, it was compared to model training based on other performance criteria. The results suggest that model training based on accuracy-based performance criteria may produce unrealistic models at extreme prevalences of the training set, whereas the aAD allows for the identification of more accurate and more reliable models. Moreover, the adjustable parameter in this criterion enables modellers to situate the optimised models in the search space and thus provides an indication of the ecological model relevance. Consequently, it may support modellers and river managers in the decision making process by improving model reliability and insight into the modelling process. Due to the universality and the flexibility of the approach, it could be applied to any other ecosystem or species, and may therefore be valuable to ecological modelling and ecosystem management in general. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

However, in some cases models produced by these algorithms may not represent optimal levels of complexity and, hence, likely either overestimate or underestimate the species' ecological tolerances. Here, we evaluate a delete-one jackknife approach for tuning model settings to approximate optimal model complexity and enhance predictions for datasets with few (here, {\textless}10) occurrence records. We apply this approach to tune two settings that regulate model complexity (feature class and regularization multiplier) in the presence-background modeling program Maxent for two species of spiny pocket mice in Ecuador and southwestern Colombia. For these datasets, we identified an optimal feature class parameter that is more complex than the default. Highly complex features are not typically recommended for use with small sample sizes in Maxent. However, when coupled with higher regularization, complex features (that allow more flexible responses to environmental variables) can obtain models that out-perform those built using default settings (employing less complex feature classes). Although small sample sizes remain a serious limitation to model building, this jackknife optimization approach can be used for species with few localities ({\textless}approximately 20-25) to produce models that maximize the utility of the little information available. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Here I suggest interrelated working definitions of these terms whereby the concept of habitat remains associated with descriptive/ correlative analyses of the environments of organisms, while the niche concept is reserved for mechanistic analyses. To model the niche mechanistically, it is necessary to understand the way an organism's morphology, physiology, and especially behaviour, determine the kinds of environment it experiences when living in a particular habitat, and it is also necessary to understand how those environmental conditions affect fitness (growth, survival and reproduction). While distributions can potentially be predicted by modelling descriptions or correlations between organisms and habitat components, we must model an organism's niche mechanistically if we are to fully explain distribution limits. A mechanistic understanding of the niche is also critical when we want to predict an organism's distribution under novel circumstances such as a species introduction or climate change},

  abstract      = {Defining species by their climatic niche is the simple and intuitive principle underlying Bioclimatic Envelope Model (BEM) predictions for climate change effects. However, these correlative models are often criticised for neglecting many ecological processes. Here, we apply the same niche principle to entire communities within a medium/long-term climate manipulation study, where ecological processes are inherently included.In a nine generation study in Israel, we manipulated rainfall (Drought -30{\%}; Irrigation +30{\%}; Control natural rainfall) at two sites which differ chiefly in rainfall quantity and variability. We analysed community responses to the manipulations by grouping species based on their climatic rainfall niche. These responses were compared to analyses based on single species, total densities, and commonly used taxonomic groupings.Climate Niche Groups yielded clear and consistent results: within communities, those species distributed in drier regions performed relatively better in the drought treatment, and those from wetter climates performed better when irrigated. In contrast, analyses based on other principles revealed little insight into community dynamics. Notably, most relationships were weaker at the drier, more variable site, suggesting that enhanced adaptation to variability may buffer climate change impacts.We provide robust experimental evidence that using climatic niches - commonly applied in BEMs - is a valid approach for eliciting community changes in response to climate change. However, we also argue that additional empirical information needs to be gathered using experiments in situ to correctly assess community vulnerability. Climatic Niche Groups used in this way, may therefore provide a powerful tool and directional testing framework to generalise and compare climate change impacts across habitats.},

As government scientists with a responsibility to communicate the best available science to our policy colleagues, we question whether current modeling approaches and outputs are practically useful. Here, we synthesize conceptual problems with species distribution models (SDMs) associated with interspecific interactions, dispersal, ecological equilibria and time lags, evolution, and the sampling of niche space. Although projected SDMs have undoubtedly been critical in alerting us to the magnitude of climate change impacts, we conclude that until they offer insights that are more precise than what we can derive from basic ecological theory, we question their utility in deciding how to allocate scarce funds to large-scale conservation projects.},

The sampling design strongly influenced the predictive performance of the models while the number of pseudo-absences had minimal effect on the predictive performance. We attribute much of these results to the relationship between the environmental range of the pseudo-absences (i.e. the extent of the environmental space being considered) and the environmental range of the presence observations (i.e. under which environmental conditions the species occurs). The number of generated pseudo-absences had a direct effect on the predicted probability, which translated to different distribution areas. Pseudo-absence observations that fell within grid cells with presence observations were purposely included in our analyses. We discourage the practice of excluding certain pseudo-absence data because it involves arbitrary assumptions about what are (un)suitable environments for the species being modelled. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

However, users of SDM software are faced with a variety of options, and it is not always obvious how selecting one option over another will affect model performance. Working with MaxEnt software and with tree fern presence data from New Zealand, we assessed whether (a) choosing to correct for geographical sampling bias and (b) using complex environmental response curves have strong effects on goodness of fit. SDMs were trained on tree fern data, obtained from an online biodiversity data portal, with two sources that differed in size and geographical sampling bias: a small, widely-distributed set of herbarium specimens and a large, spatially clustered set of ecological survey records. We attempted to correct for geographical sampling bias by incorporating sampling bias grids in the SDMs, created from all georeferenced vascular plants in the datasets, and explored model complexity issues by fitting a wide variety of environmental response curves (known as "feature types" in MaxEnt). In each case, goodness of fit was assessed by comparing predicted range maps with tree fern presences and absences using an independent national dataset to validate the SDMs. We found that correcting for geographical sampling bias led to major improvements in goodness of fit, but did not entirely resolve the problem: predictions made with clustered ecological data were inferior to those made with the herbarium dataset, even after sampling bias correction. We also found that the choice of feature type had negligible effects on predictive performance, indicating that simple feature types may be sufficient once sampling bias is accounted for. Our study emphasizes the importance of reducing geographical sampling bias, where possible, in datasets used to train SDMs, and the effectiveness and essentialness of sampling bias correction within MaxEnt.},

            {\textless}p{\textgreater}Advances in tracking technology have led to an exponential increase in animal location data, greatly enhancing our ability to address interesting questions in movement ecology, but also presenting new challenges related to data management and analysis. Step‐selection functions (SSFs) are commonly used to link environmental covariates to animal location data collected at fine temporal resolution. SSFs are estimated by comparing observed steps connecting successive animal locations to random steps, using a likelihood equivalent of a Cox proportional hazards model. By using common statistical distributions to model step length and turn angle distributions, and including habitat‐ and movement‐related covariates (functions of distances between points, angular deviations), it is possible to make inference regarding habitat selection and movement processes or to control one process while investigating the other. The fitted model can also be used to estimate utilization distributions and mechanistic home ranges. Here, we present the R package {\textless}span{\textgreater}amt{\textless}/span{\textgreater} (animal movement tools) that allows users to fit SSFs to data and to simulate space use of animals from fitted models. The {\textless}span{\textgreater}amt{\textless}/span{\textgreater} package also provides tools for managing telemetry data. Using fisher ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Pekania pennanti{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) data as a case study, we illustrate a four‐step approach to the analysis of animal movement data, consisting of data management, exploratory data analysis, fitting of models, and simulating from fitted models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

As a result, information on phylogenetic relationships has underappreciated potential to inform ecological niche modeling. Here we review three strategies for incorporating evolutionary information into niche models: splitting lineages into subunits, lumping across lineages, and partial pooling of lineages into a common statistical framework that implicitly or explicitly accounts for evolutionary relationships. We challenge the default practice of modeling at the species level, which ignores the process of niche evolution and erroneously assumes that the species is always the appropriate level for niche estimation. Progress in the field requires reexamination of how we assess models of niches versus models of distributions.},

  abstract      = {1. Few examples of habitat-modelling studies of rare and endangered species exist in the literature, although from a conservation perspective predicting their distribution would prove particularly useful. Paucity of data and lack of valid absences are the probable reasons for this shortcoming. Analytic solutions to accommodate the lack of absence include the ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) and the use of generalized linear models (GLM) with simulated pseudo-absences. 2. In this study we tested a new approach to generating pseudo-absences, based on a preliminary ENFA habitat suitability (HS) map, for the endangered species Eryngium alpinum . This method of generating pseudo-absences was compared with two others: (i) use of a GLM with pseudo-absences generated totally at random, and (ii) use of an ENFA only. 3. The influence of two different spatial resolutions (i.e. grain) was also assessed for tack- ling the dilemma of quality (grain) vs. quantity (number of occurrences). Each combination of the three above-mentioned methods with the two grains generated a distinct HS map. 4. Four evaluation measures were used for comparing these HS maps: total deviance explained, best kappa, Gini coefficient and minimal predicted area (MPA). The last is a new evaluation criterion proposed in this study. 5. Results showed that (i) GLM models using ENFA-weighted pseudo-absence provide better results, except for the MPA value, and that (ii) quality (spatial resolution and locational accuracy) of the data appears to be more important than quantity (number of occurrences). Furthermore, the proposed MPA value is suggested as a useful measure of model evaluation when used to complement classical statistical measures. 6. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that the use of ENFA-weighted pseudo- absence is a possible way to enhance the quality of GLM-based potential distribution maps and that data quality (i.e. spatial resolution) prevails over quantity (i.e. number of data). Increased accuracy of potential distribution maps could help to define better suitable areas for species protection and reintroduction. Key-words},

  abstract      = {Species distribution models have often been developed based on ecological data. To develop reliable data-driven models, however, a sound model training and evaluation procedures are needed. A crucial step in these procedures is the assessment of the model performance, with as key component the applied performance criterion. Therefore, we reviewed seven performance criteria commonly applied in presence-absence modelling (the correctly classified instances, Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, the normalised mutual information statistic, the true skill statistic and the odds ratio) and analysed their application in both the model training and evaluation process. Although estimates of predictive performance have been used widely to assess final model quality, a systematic overview was missing because most analyses of performance criteria have been empirical and only focused on specific aspects of the performance criteria. This paper provides such an overview showing that different performance criteria evaluate a model differently and that this difference may be explained by the dependency of these criteria on the prevalence of the validation set. We showed theoretically that these prevalence effects only occur if the data are inseparable by an n-dimensional hyperplane, n being the number of input variables. Given this inseparability, different performance criteria focus on different aspects of model performance during model training, such as sensitivity, specificity or predictive accuracy. These findings have important consequences for ecological modelling because ecological data are mostly inseparable due to data noise and the complexity of the studied system. Consequently, it should be very clear which aspect of the model performance is evaluated, and models should be evaluated consistently, that is, independent of, or taking into account, species prevalence. The practical implications of these findings are clear. They provide further insight into the evaluation of ecological presence/absence models and attempt to assist modellers in their choice of suitable performance criteria. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract      = {1. In the UK, resolving conflicts between the conservation of grey seals, the management of fish stocks and marine exploitation requires knowledge of the seals' use of space. We present a map of grey seal usage around the British Isles based on satellite telemetry data from adult animals and haul-out survey data. 2. Our approach combined modelling and interpolation. To model the seals' association with particular coastal sites (the haul-outs), we divided the population into subpopulations associated with 24 haul-out groups. Haul-out-specific maps of accessibility were used to supervise usage estimation from satellite telemetry. The mean and variance of seal numbers at each haul-out group were obtained from haul-out counts. The aggregate map of usage for the entire population was produced by adding together the haul-out-specific usage maps, weighted by mean number of animals using that haul-out. 3. Seal usage was primarily concentrated (i) off the northern coasts of the British Isles, (ii) closer to the coast than might be expected purely on the basis of accessibility from the haul-outs and (iii) in a limited number of marine hot-spots. 4. Although our results currently represent the best estimate of how grey seals use the marine environment around Britain, they are neither definitive nor equally precise for all haul-outs. Further data collection should focus in the south-west of the British isles and aerial counts should be repeated for all haul-outs. 5. Synthesis and applications. This work provides environmental managers with current estimates of grey seal usage and describes a methodology for maximizing data efficiency. Our results could guide government departments in licensing marine exploitation by the oil industry, in estimating grey seal predation pressure on vulnerable or economically important prey and in delineating marine special areas of conservation (SAC). Our finding that grey seal usage is characterized by a limited number of hot-spots means that the species is particularly suited to localized conservation efforts.},

  abstract      = {The performance of statistical methods for modeling resource selection by animals is difficult to evaluate with field data because true selection patterns are unknown. Simulated data based on a known probability distribution, though, can be used to evaluate statistical methods. Models should estimate true selection patterns if they are to be useful in analyzing and interpreting field data. We used simulation techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of three statistical methods used in modeling resource selection. We generated 25 use locations per animal and included 10, 20, 40, or 80 animals in samples of use locations. To simulate species of different mobility, we generated use locations at four levels according to a known probability distribution across DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR) in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, USA. We either generated 5 random locations per use location or 10,000 random locations (total) within 4 predetermined areas around use locations to determine how the definition of availability and the number of random locations affected results. We analyzed simulated data using discrete choice, logistic-regression, and a maximum entropy method (Maxent). We used a simple linear regression of estimated and known probability distributions and area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) to evaluate the performance of each method. Each statistical method was affected differently by number of animals and random locations used in analyses, level at which selection of resources occurred, and area considered available. Discrete-choice modeling resulted in precise and accurate estimates of the true probability distribution when the area in which use locations were generated was ≥ the area defined to be available. Logistic-regression models were unbiased and precise when the area in which use locations were generated and the area defined to be available were the same size; the fit of these models improved with increased numbers of random locations. Maxent resulted in unbiased and precise estimates of the known probability distribution when the area in which use locations were generated was small (home-range level) and the area defined to be available was large (study area). Based on AUC analyses, all models estimated the selection distribution better than random chance. Results from AUC analyses, however, often contradicted results of the linear regression method used to evaluate model performance. Discrete-choice modeling was best able to estimate the known selection distribution in our study area regardless of sample size or number of random locations used in the analyses, but we recommend further studies using simulated data over different landscapes and different resource metrics to confirm our results. Our study offers an approach and guidance for others interested in assessing the utility of techniques for modeling resource selection in their study area. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

The two dominant approaches for the analysis of species–habitat associations in animals have been shown to reach divergent conclusions. Models fitted from the viewpoint of an individual (step selection functions), once scaled up, do not agree with models fitted from a population viewpoint (resource selection functions [RSFs]). We explain this fundamental incompatibility, and propose a solution by introducing to the animal movement field a novel use for the well-known family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. By design, the step selection rules of MCMC lead to a steady-state distribution that coincides with a given underlying function: the target distribution. We therefore propose an analogy between the movements of an animal and the movements of an MCMC sampler, to guarantee convergence of the step selection rules to the parameters underlying the population's utilization distribution. We introduce a rejection-free MCMC algorithm, the local Gibbs sampler, that better resembles real animal movement, and discuss the wide range of biological assumptions that it can accommodate. We illustrate our method with simulations on a known utilization distribution, and show theoretically and empirically that locations simulated from the local Gibbs sampler give rise to the correct RSF. Using simulated data, we demonstrate how this framework can be used to estimate resource selection and movement parameters.},

  abstract      = {Species distribution models (SDM) are commonly used to obtain hypotheses on either the realized or the potential distribution of species. The reliability and meaning of these hypotheses depends on the kind of absences included in the training data, the variables used as predictors and the methods employed to parameterize the models. Information about the absence of species from certain localities is usually lacking, so pseudo-absences are often incorporated to the training data. We explore the effect of using different kinds of pseudo-absences on SDM results. To do this, we use presence information on Aphodius bonvouloiri, a dung beetle species of well-known distribution. We incorporate different types of pseudo-absences to create different sets of training data that account for absences of methodological (i.e. false absences), contingent and environmental origin. We used these datasets to calibrate SDMs with GAMs as modelling technique and climatic variables as predictors, and compare these results with geographical representations of the potential and realized distribution of the species created independently. Our results confirm the importance of the kind of absences in determining the aspect of species distribution identified through SDM. Estimations of the potential distribution require absences located farther apart in the geographic and/or environmental space than estimations of the realized distribution. Methodological absences produce overall bad models, and absences that are too far from the presence points in either the environmental or the geographic space may not be informative, yielding important overestimations. GLMs and Artificial Neural Networks yielded similar results. Synthetic discrimination measures such as the Area Under the Receiver Characteristic Curve (AUC) must be interpreted with caution, as they can produce misleading comparative results. Instead, the joint examination of ommission and comission errors provides a better understanding of the reliability of SDM results.},

Here, we define and differentiate between process-based and mechanistic features of models, and we identify and discuss important advantages of working with models possessing such features. We describe some of the risks associated with process-based and mechanistic model-centered research programs, and we propose ways to mitigate these risks. Giving process-based and mechanistic models a more central role in research programs can reinvigorate macroecology by strengthening the link between theory and data. Macroecologists are increasingly using process-based and mechanistic models. Process-based models need not be reductionistic. Such models can be used for theoretical, statistical, and virtual-worlds modelling. These innovations allow stronger inferences about causes of ecological patterns.},

  abstract      = {1. Habitat selection strategies translate into movement tactics, which reckon with the predator-prey spatial game. Strategic habitat selection analysis can therefore illuminate behavioural games. Cover types at potential encounter sites (i.e. intersections between movement paths of predator and prey) can be compared with cover types available (i) within the area of home-range-overlap (HRO) between predator and prey; and (ii) along the path (MP) of each species. Unlike the HRO scale, cover-type availability at MP scale differs between interacting species due to species-specific movement decisions. Scale differences in selection could therefore inform on divergences in fitness rewarding actions between predators and prey. 2. We used this framework to evaluate the spatial game between GPS-collared wolves (Canis lupus) versus caribou (Rangifer tarandus), and wolf versus moose (Alces alces). 3. Changes in cover-type availability between HRO and MP revealed differences in how each species fine-tuned its movements to habitat features. In contrast to caribou, wolves increased their encounter rate with regenerating cuts along their paths (MP) relative to the HRO level. As a consequence, wolves were less likely to cross caribou paths in areas with higher percentage of regenerating cuts than expected based on the availability along their paths, whereas caribou had a higher risk of intersecting wolf paths by crossing these areas, relative to random expectation along their paths. Unlike for caribou, availability of mixed and deciduous areas decreased from HRO to MP level for wolves and moose. Overall, wolves displayed stronger similarities in movement decisions with moose than with caribou, thereby revealing the focus of wolves on moose. 4. Our study reveals how differences in fine-scale movement tactics between species create asymmetric relative encounter probabilities between predators and prey, given their paths. Increase in relative risk of encounter for prey and decrease for predators associated with specific cover types emerging from HRO to MP scale analysis can disclose potential weaknesses in current movement tactics involved the predator-prey game, such as caribou use of cutovers in summer-autumn. In turn, these weaknesses can inform on subsequent changes in habitat selection tactics that might arise due to evolutionary forces.},

  abstract      = {1. Describing distribution and abundance is requisite to exploring interactions between organisms and their environment. Recently, the resource selection function (RSF) has emerged to replace many of the statistical procedures used to quantify resource selection by animals. 2. A RSF is defined by characteristics measured on resource units such that its value for a unit is proportional to the probability ofthat unit being used by an organism. It is solved using a variety of techniques, particularly the binomial generalized linear model. 3. Observing dynamics in a RSF - obtaining substantially different functions at different times or places for the same species - alerts us to the varying ecological processes that underlie resource selection. 4. We believe that there is a need for us to reacquaint ourselves with ecological theory when interpret- ing RSF models. We outline a suite of factors likely to govern ecologically based variation in a RSF. In particular, we draw attention to competition and density-dependent habitat selection, the role of pr{\'{e}}dation, longitudinal changes in resource availability and functional responses in resource use. 5. How best to incorporate governing factors in a RSF is currently in a state of development; how- ever, we see promise in the inclusion of random as well as fixed effects in resource selection models, and matched case-control logistic regression. 6. Investigating the basis of ecological dynamics in a RSF will allow us to develop more robust models when applied to forecasting the spatial distribution of animals. It may also further our understanding of the relative importance of ecological interactions on the distribution and abun- dance of species},

  abstract      = {Colonial seabirds are relatively easy to observe, count, measure and manipulate, and consequently have long been used as models for testing ecological hypotheses. A combination of animal tracking and satellite imagery has the potential to greatly inform such efforts, by allowing seabird-environment interactions to be observed remotely. We review how this can be achieved by applying innovative statistical techniques to quantify habitat use and preferences. Seabird movements are now observable at scales of meters using GPS loggers, and up to several years using light-based geolocation, while satellite remote sensing systems, at resolutions of km, are capable of characterizing the millions of km(2) of habitat that are accessible to seabirds. Physical forcing and biological processes result in a hierarchical, patchy distribution of prey. Hence, analyses of seabird movements should be conducted at appropriate scales. Variation in habitat accessibility should also be considered: this declines with distance from the colony during the breeding season, when seabirds are central place foragers, and may be limited in the nonbreeding period by migration corridors that are defined by wind patterns. Intraspecific competition can further modify spatial usage, leading to spatial segregation of birds foraging from different colonies. We recommend that spatial usage be modeled as a function of habitat preference, accessibility and, potentially, competition. At the population level, this is currently best achieved using an empirical approach (e.g. using mixed-effects generalized additive models), At the individual level, more mechanistic models (e.g. state-space models) are more appropriate and have the advantage of modeling location errors explicitly.},

Although occurrence models have been widely used for describing species distribution, particularly for rare species, abundance models are less common, despite greater information for conservation and management. Because presence-absence data are easier and less expensive to collect, predictions of abundance from patterns ofoccurrence could prove useful. We examined the relationship between occurrence and abundance for two species with very different life histories: bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum and moose Alces alces. We predicted that if occurrence and abundance were functionally related we should observe: 1) correlation between predicted probability of occurrence and observed abundance; 2) similar environmental covariates and estimated coefficients for occurrence models developed separately for low-density, high-density, and global data sites; and 3) parallel coefficients for the occurrence and abundance components of zero-inflated count models. Probability of occurrence was not correlated with abundance-when-present for bracken fern, while evidence for a relationship for moose was apparent at densities of animals below 7 individuals per cutblock. Coefficients for models at different levels of density did not vary significantly. However, once occurrence was accounted for, measured environmental data appeared less important in describing abundance. For bracken, covariates of zero-inflated count models differed in their expression of occurrence and abundance. Differences were less extreme for moose; however, results from the two-process models suggest that distribution and abundance may be a function of different processes. Environmental factors influencing abundance may differ from those limiting distribution. Life history, scale, site history, and socio- competitive processes further help shape patterns of abundance. Two-stage modeling provides a powerful tool for describing animal and plant distribution where the processes of occurrence and abundance are influenced by different factors. S.},

  abstract      = {Habitat selection may occur in situations in which animals experience a trade-off, e.g. between the use of habitats with abundant forage and the use of safer retreat habitats with little forage. Such trade-offs may yield relative habitat use conditional on the relative availability of the different habitat types, as proportional use of foraging habitat may exceed proportional availability when foraging habitat is scarce, but be less than availability when foraging habitat is abundant. Hence, trade-offs in habitat use may result in functional responses in habitat use (i.e. change in relative use with changing availability). We used logistic and log-linear models to model functional responses in female polar bear habitat use based on satellite telemetry data from two contiguous populations; one near shore inhabiting sea ice within fjords, and one inhabiting pelagic drift ice. Open ice, near the ice edge, is a highly dynamic habitat hypothesised to be important polar bear habitat due to high prey availability. In open ice-polar bears may experience a high energetic cost of movements and risk drifting away from the main ice field (i.e. trade off between feeding and energy saving or safety). If polar bears were constrained by ice dynamics we therefore predicted use of retreat habitats with greater ice coverage relative to habitats used for hunting. The polar bears demonstrated season and population specific functional responses in habitat use, likely reflecting seasonal and regional variation in use of retreat and foraging habitats. We suggest that in seasons with functional responses in habitat use, polar bear space use and population distribution may not be a mere reflection of prey availability but rather reflect the alternate allocation of time in hunting and retreat habitats.

  abstract      = {A general discrete-time modeling framework for animal movement using multistate random walks. Ecological Monographs, 82 (3). pp. 335-349. Abstract. Recent developments in animal tracking technology have permitted the collection of detailed data on the movement paths of individuals from many species. However, analysis methods for these data have not developed at a similar pace, largely due to a lack of suitable candidate models, coupled with the technical difficulties of fitting such models to data. To facilitate a general modeling framework, we propose that complex movement paths can be conceived as a series of movement strategies among which animals transition as they are affected by changes in their internal and external environment. We synthesize previously existing and novel methodologies to develop a general suite of mechanistic models based on biased and correlated random walks that allow different behavioral states for directed (e.g., migration), exploratory (e.g., dispersal), area-restricted (e.g., foraging), and other types of movement. Using this ''toolbox'' of nested model components, multistate movement models may be custom-built for a wide variety of species and applications. As a unified state-space modeling framework, it allows the simultaneous investigation of numerous hypotheses about animal movement from imperfectly observed data, including time allocations to different movement behavior states, transitions between states, the use of memory or navigation, and strengths of attraction (or repulsion) to specific locations. The inclusion of covariate information permits further investigation of specific hypotheses related to factors driving different types of movement behavior. Using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to facilitate Bayesian model selection and multi-model inference, we apply the proposed methodology to real data by adapting it to the natural history of the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) in the North Sea. Although previous grey seal studies tended to focus on correlated movements, we found overwhelming evidence that bias toward haul-out or foraging locations better explained seal movement than did simple or correlated random walks. Posterior model probabilities also provided evidence that seals transition among directed, area-restricted, and exploratory movements associated with haul-out, foraging, and other behaviors. With this intuitive framework for modeling and interpreting animal movement, we believe that the development and application of custom-made movement models will become more accessible to ecologists and non-statisticians.},

  abstract      = {{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2015. Species distribution maps can provide important information to focus conservation efforts and enable spatial management of human activities. Two sympatric marine predators, grey seals Halichoerus grypus and harbour seals Phoca vitulina, have overlapping ranges on land and at sea but contrasting population dynamics around Britain: whilst grey seals have generally increased, harbour seals have shown significant regional declines. We analysed 2 decades of atsea movement data and terrestrial count data from these species to produce high resolution, broad-scale maps of distribution and associated uncertainty to inform conservation and management. Our results showed that grey seals use offshore areas connected to their haul-out sites by prominent corridors, and harbour seals primarily stay within 50 km of the coastline. Both species show fine-scale offshore spatial segregation off the east coast of Britain and broad-scale partitioning off western Scotland. These results illustrate that, for broad-scale marine spatial planning, the conservation needs of harbour seals (primarily inshore, the exception being selected offshore usage areas) are different from those of grey seals (up to 100 km offshore and corridors connecting these areas to haul-out sites). More generally, our results illustrate the importance of detailed knowledge of marine predator distributions to inform marine spatial planning; for instance, spatial prioritisation is not necessarily the most effective spatial planning strategy even when conserving species with similar taxonomy.},

  abstract      = {Given the importance of knowledge of species distribution for conservation and climate change management, continuous and progressive evaluation of the statistical models predicting species distributions is necessary. Current models are evaluated in terms of ecological theory used, the data model accepted and the statistical methods applied. Focus is restricted to Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Generalised Additive Models (GAM). Certain currently unused regression methods are reviewed for their possible application to species modelling. A review of recent papers suggests that ecological theory is rarely explicitly considered. Current theory and results support species responses to environmental variables to be unimodal and often skewed though process-based theory is often lacking. Many studies fail to test for unimodal or skewed responses and straight-line relationships are often fitted without justification. Data resolution (size of sampling unit) determines the nature of the environmental niche models that can be fitted. A synthesis of differing ecophysiological ideas and the use of biophysical processes models could improve the selection of predictor variables. A better conceptual framework is needed for selecting variables. Comparison of statistical methods is difficult. Predictive success is insufficient and a test of ecological realism is also needed. Evaluation of methods needs artificial data, as there is no knowledge about the true relationships between variables for field data. However, use of artificial data is limited by lack of comprehensive theory. Three potentially new methods are reviewed. Quantile regression (QR) has potential and a strong theoretical justification in Liebig's law of the minimum. Structural equation modelling (SEM) has an appealing conceptual framework for testing causality but has problems with curvilinear relationships. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) intended to examine spatial non-stationarity of ecological processes requires further evaluation before being used. Synthesis and applications: explicit theory needs to be incorporated into species response models used in conservation. For example, testing for unimodal skewed responses should be a routine procedure. Clear statements of the ecological theory used, the nature of the data model and sufficient details of the statistical method are needed for current models to be evaluated. New statistical methods need to be evaluated for compatibility with ecological theory before use in applied ecology. Some recent work with artificial data suggests the combination of ecological knowledge and statistical skill is more important than the precise statistical method used. The potential exists for a synthesis of current species modelling approaches based on their differing ecological insights not their methodology. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006.},

  abstract      = {Prioritizing habitats for conservation is a challenging task, particularly for species with fluctuating populations and seasonally dynamic habitat needs. Although the use of resource selection models to identify and prioritize habitat for conservation is increasingly common, their ability to characterize important long-term habitats for dynamic populations are variable. To examine how habitats might be prioritized differently if resource selection was directly and dynamically linked with population fluctuations and movement limitations among seasonal habitats, we constructed a spatially explicit individual-based model for a dramatically fluctuating population requiring temporally varying resources. Using greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in Wyoming as a case study, we used resource selection function maps to guide seasonal movement and habitat selection, but emergent population dynamics and simulated movement limitations modified long-term habitat occupancy. We compared priority habitats in RSF maps to long-term simulated habitat use. We examined the circumstances under which the explicit consideration of movement limitations, in combination with population fluctuations and trends, are likely to alter predictions of important habitats. In doing so, we assessed the future occupancy of protected areas under alternative population and habitat conditions. Habitat prioritizations based on resource selection models alone predicted high use in isolated parcels of habitat and in areas with low connectivity among seasonal habitats. In contrast, results based on more biologically-informed simulations emphasized central and connected areas near high-density populations, sometimes predicted to be low selection value. Dynamic models of habitat use can provide additional biological realism that can extend, and in some cases, contradict habitat use predictions generated from short-term or static resource selection analyses. The explicit inclusion of population dynamics and movement propensities via spatial simulation modeling frameworks may provide an informative means of predicting long-term habitat use, particularly for fluctuating populations with complex seasonal habitat needs. Importantly, our results indicate the possible need to consider habitat selection models as a starting point rather than the common end point for refining and prioritizing habitats for protection for cyclic and highly variable populations.},

  abstract      = {A common population characteristic of interest in animal ecology studies pertains to the selection of resources. That is, given the resources available to animals, what do they ultimately choose to use? A variety of statistical approaches have been employed to examine this question and each has advantages and disadvantages with respect to the form of available data and the properties of estimators given model assumptions. A wealth of high resolution telemetry data are now being collected to study animal population movement and space use and these data present both challenges and opportunities for statistical inference. We summarize traditional methods for resource selection and then describe several extensions to deal with measurement uncertainty and an explicit movement process that exists in studies involving high-resolution telemetry data. Our approach uses a correlated random walk movement model to obtain temporally varying use and availability distributions that are employed in a weighted distribution context to estimate selection coefficients. The temporally varying coefficients are then weighted by their contribution to selection and combined to provide inference at the population level. The result is an intuitive and accessible statistical procedure that uses readily available software and is computationally feasible for large datasets. These methods are demonstrated using data collected as part of a large-scale mountain lion monitoring study in Colorado, USA.},

  abstract      = {Summary 1. Species distribution models are increasingly used to address questions in conservation biology, ecology and evolution. The most effective species distribution models require data on both species presence and the available environmental conditions (known as background or pseudo-absence data) in the area. However, there is still no consensus on how and where to sample these pseudo-absences and how many. 2. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis based on simple simulated species distributions to propose guidelines on how, where and how many pseudo-absences should be generated to build reliable species distribution models. Depending on the quantity and quality of the initial presence data (unbiased vs. climatically or spatially biased), we assessed the relative effect of the method for selecting pseudo-absences (random vs. environmentally or spatially stratified) and their number on the predictive accuracy of seven common modelling techniques (regression, classification and machine-learning techniques). 3. When using regression techniques, the method used to select pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on the model's predictive accuracy. Randomly selected pseudo-absences yielded the most reliable distribution models. Models fitted with a large number of pseudo-absences but equally weighted to the presences (i.e. the weighted sum of presence equals the weighted sum of pseudo-absence) produced the most accurate predicted distributions. For classification and machine-learning techniques, the number of pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on model accuracy, and averaging several runs with fewer pseudo-absences than for regression techniques yielded the most predictive models. 4. Overall, we recommend the use of a large number (e.g. 10 000) of pseudo-absences with equal weighting for presences and absences when using regression techniques (e.g. generalised linear model and generalised additive model); averaging several runs (e.g. 10) with fewer pseudo-absences (e.g. 100) with equal weighting for presences and absences with multiple adaptive regression splines and discriminant analyses; and using the same number of pseudo-absences as available presences (averaging several runs if few pseudo-absences) for classification techniques such as boosted regression trees, classification trees and random forest. In addition, we recommend the random selection of pseudo-absences when using regression techniques and the random selection of geographically and environmentally stratified pseudo-absences when using classification and machine-learning techniques.},

  abstract      = {A long-standing theory, originating with Darwin, suggests that abiotic forces set species range limits at high latitude, high elevation, and other abiotically 'stressful' areas, while species interactions set range limits in apparently more benign regions. This theory is of considerable importance for both basic and applied ecology, and while it is often assumed to be a ubiquitous pattern, it has not been clearly defined or broadly tested. We review tests of this idea and dissect how the strength of species interactions must vary across stress gradients to generate the predicted pattern. We conclude by suggesting approaches to better test this theory, which will deepen our understanding of the forces that determine species ranges and govern responses to climate change. Both climate and species interactions set species range limits, but it is unclear when each is most important.An old hypothesis, first proposed by Darwin, suggests that abiotic factors should be key drivers of limits in abiotically stressful areas, and species interactions should dominate in abiotically benign areas.Four distinct mechanisms, ranging from per-capita effects to community-level synergies, could result in differential importance of species interactions across stress gradients.These mechanisms, operating alone or in tandem, can result in patterns consistent or inconsistent with Darwin's hypothesis, depending on the strength and direction of effects.The most robust test of this hypothesis, not to date performed in any study, is to analyze how sensitive range limit location is to changes in the strength of one or more species interactions and also to abiotic stressors.},

  abstract      = {Conserving species biodiversity demands decisive and effective action. Effective action requires an understanding of species population dynamics. Therefore, robust measures which track temporal changes in species populations are needed. This need, however, must be balanced against the scale at which population change is being assessed. Advances in citizen science and remote sensing technology have heralded an era of “big unstructured data” for biodiversity conservation. However, the value of big unstructured data for assessing changes in species populations, and effectively guiding conservation management has not been rigorously assessed. This can be achieved only by benchmarking big unstructured data against high-quality structured datasets, and ensuring the latter are not lost through an over-emphasis on “big data”. Here, we illustrate the current trend to disproportionately prioritise data quantity over data quality and highlight the discrepancy in global availability between both data types. We propose a research agenda to test whether this trend will result in a net decrease of useful knowledge for biodiversity conservation. We exemplify this by examining the availability of big unstructured data vs standardised data using data from global repositories on birds as an example. We share experiences from the data collation exercise needed to develop the Australian Threatened Species Index. We argue there is an urgent need to validate and enhance the utility of big unstructured data by: 1) maintaining existing well-designed, standardised long-term species population studies; 2) strengthening data quality control, management, and curation of any type of dataset; and 3) developing purpose-specific rankings to assess data quality.},

  abstract      = {1. Evaluating landscape connectivity and identifying and protecting corridors for animal movement have become central challenges in applied ecology and conservation. Currently, resource selection analyses are widely used to focus corridor planning where animal movement is predicted to occur. An animal's behavioural state (e.g. foraging, dispersing) is a significant determinant of resource selection patterns, yet has largely been ignored in connectivity assessments. 2. We review 16 years of connectivity studies employing resource selection analysis to evaluate how researchers have incorporated animal behaviour into corridor planning, and highlight promising new approaches for identifying wildlife corridors. To illustrate the importance of behavioural information in such analyses, we present an empirical case study to test behaviour- specific predictions of connectivity with long-distance dispersal movements of African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. We conclude by recommending strategies for developing more realistic connectivity models for future conservation efforts. 3. Our review indicates that most connectivity studies conflate resource selection with connectivity requirements, which may result in misleading estimates of landscape resistance, and lack validation of proposed connectivity models with movement data. 4. Our case study shows that including only directed movement behaviour when measuring resource selection reveals markedly different, and more accurate, connectivity estimates than a model measuring resource selection independent of behavioural state. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results, using African wild dogs as a case study, suggest that resource selection analyses that fail to consider an animal's behavioural state may be insufficient in targeting movement pathways and corridors for protection. This failure may result in misidentification of wildlife corridors and misallocation of limited conservation resources. Our findings underscore the need for considering patterns of animal movement in appropriate behavioural contexts to ensure the effective application of resource selection analyses for corridor planning.},

Location Europe, North America and South America. Methods The framework applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occur- rence in gridded environmental space to calculatemetrics of niche overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We use this framework and simulated species with pre-defined distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several ordination and species distribution modelling techniques for quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with data on two well-studied invasive species. Results We show that niche overlap can be accurately detected with the frame- work when variables driving the distributions are known. The method is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of environmental conditions that occur across geo- graphical space. The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from geographical space tomultivariate environmental space independent of both sam- pling effort and arbitrary choice of resolution in environmental space.However, the use of ordination and species distributionmodel techniques for selecting, combin- ing and weighting variables on which niche overlap is calculated provide contrast- ing results. Main conclusions The framework meets the increasing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate for studying niche differences between species, subspecies or intra-specific lineages that differ in their geographi- cal distributions. Alternatively, it can be used to measure the degree to which the environmental niche of a species or intra-specific lineage has changed over time. Keywords},

  abstract      = {Patterns of resource selection by animal populations emerge as a result of the behavior of many individuals. Statistical models that describe these population-level patterns of habitat use can miss important interactions between individual animals and characteristics of their local environment; however, identifying these interactions is difficult. One approach to this problem is to incorporate models of individual movement into resource selection models. To do this, we propose a model for step selection functions (SSF) that is composed of a resource-independent movement kernel and a resource selection function (RSF). We show that standard case-control logistic regression may be used to fit the SSF; however, the sampling scheme used to generate control points (i.e., the definition of availability) must be accommodated. We used three sampling schemes to analyze simulated movement data and found that ignoring sampling and the resource-independent movement kernel yielded biased estimates of selection. The level of bias depended on the method used to generate control locations, the strength of selection, and the spatial scale of the resource map. Using empirical or parametric methods to sample control locations produced biased estimates under stronger selection; however, we show that the addition of a distance function to the analysis substantially reduced that bias. Assuming a uniform availability within a fixed buffer yielded strongly biased selection estimates that could be corrected by including the distance function but remained inefficient relative to the empirical and parametric sampling methods. As a case study, we used location data collected from elk in Yellowstone National Park, USA, to show that selection and bias may be temporally variable. Because under constant selection the amount of bias depends on the scale at which a resource is distributed in the landscape, we suggest that distance always be included as a covariate in SSF analyses. This approach to modeling resource selection is easily implemented using common statistical tools and promises to provide deeper insight into the movement ecology of animals.},

  abstract      = {Predicting space use patterns of animals from their interactions with the environment is fundamental for understanding the effect of habitat changes on ecosystem functioning. Recent attempts to address this problem have sought to unify resource selection analysis, where animal space use is derived from available habitat quality, and mechanistic movement models, where detailed movement processes of an animal are used to predict its emergent utilization distribution. Such models bias the animal's movement towards patches that are easily available and resource-rich, and the result is a predicted probability density at a given position being a function of the habitat quality at that position. However, in reality, the probability that an animal will use a patch of the terrain tends to be a function of the resource quality in both that patch and the surrounding habitat.We propose a mechanistic model where this non-local effect of resources naturally emerges from the local movement processes, by taking into account the relative utility of both the habitat where the animal currently resides and that of where it is moving. We give statistical techniques to parametrize the model from location data and demonstrate application of these techniques to GPS location data of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in Newfoundland.Steady-state animal probability distributions arising from the model have complex patterns that cannot be expressed simply as a function of the local quality of the habitat. In particular, large areas of good habitat are used more intensively than smaller patches of equal quality habitat, whereas isolated patches are used less frequently. Both of these are real aspects of animal space use missing from previous mechanistic resource selection models.Whilst we focus on habitats in this study, our modelling framework can be readily used with any environmental covariates and therefore represents a unification of mechanistic modelling and step selection approaches to understanding animal space use.},

  abstract      = {1.Understanding the factors affecting species occurrence is a pre-eminent focus of applied ecological research. However, direct information about species occurrence is lacking for many species. Instead, researchers sometimes have to rely on so-called presence-only data (i.e. when no direct information about absences is available), which often results from opportunistic, unstructured sampling. maxent is a widely used software program designed to model and map species distribution using presence-only data. 2.We provide a critical review of maxent as applied to species distribution modelling and discuss how it can lead to inferential errors. A chief concern is that maxent produces a number of poorly defined indices that are not directly related to the actual parameter of interest – the probability of occurrence ($\psi$). This focus on an index was motivated by the belief that it is not possible to estimate $\psi$ from presence-only data; however, we demonstrate that $\psi$ is identifiable using conventional likelihood methods under the assumptions of random sampling and constant probability of species detection. 3.The model is implemented in a convenient r package which we use to apply the model to simulated data and data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. We demonstrate that maxent produces extreme under-predictions when compared to estimates produced by logistic regression which uses the full (presence/absence) data set. We note that maxent predictions are extremely sensitive to specification of the background prevalence, which is not objectively estimated using the maxent method. 4.As with maxent, formal model-based inference requires a random sample of presence locations. Many presence-only data sets, such as those based on museum records and herbarium collections, may not satisfy this assumption. However, when sampling is random, we believe that inference should be based on formal methods that facilitate inference about interpretable ecological quantities instead of vaguely defined indices.},

Key features of NPMR are interactive effects of predictors, no need to specify an overall model form in advance, and built-in controls on overfitting. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with simulated and real data sets.

  abstract      = {Animals are not distributed randomly in space and time because their movement ecology is influenced by a variety of factors. Energy landscapes and the landscape of fear have recently emerged as largely independent paradigms, both reshaping our perspectives and thinking relating to the spatial ecology of animals across heterogeneous landscapes. We argue that these paradigms are not distinct but rather complementary, collectively providing a better mechanistic basis for understanding the spatial ecology and decision-making of wild animals. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of each paradigm and illuminate their complementary nature through case studies, then integrate these concepts quantitatively by constructing quantitative pathways of movement modulated by energy and fear to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the spatial ecology of wild animals.},

  abstract      = {Range maps provide important information in species conservation management, specially in the case of rare species of conservation interest. For the vast majority of cases, this information can only be estimated by means of species distribution modelling. When absence data is unavailable, modelled distribution maps represent the spatial variation of the degree of suitability for the species rather than their realised distribution. Although discerning potentially suitable areas for a given species is an important asset in conservation, it is necessary to estimate current distributions in order to preserve current populations. This work explores the use of species distribution modelling (Maxent) for species of conservation interest when their Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is well-known and there is quality occurrence data. In this case, derived binary maps of potentially suitable areas can be obtained and used to assess the conservation and protection status of a given species in combination with the EOO and existing protected area networks. Seven species, which are rare and endemic to the Western Mediterranean, have been used as an example. Valuable information for conservation assessment such as potentially suitable areas, EOO, Areas of Occupancy (AOO) and degree of protection is provided for this set of species. In addition, the existing informal view that among experts these species have range sizes much smaller than their potentially suitable area is confirmed. This could probably be attributed to important but currently unknown predictor variables and to historical phylogeographic factors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

When this assumption is incorrect, extinction risk estimated from species distribution models can be misleading. The degree to which species can tolerate or even thrive under conditions found beyond their current distributions alters extinction risks, time lags in realizing those risks, and the usefulness of alternative management strategies. To inform these issues, we propose a conceptual framework within which empirical data could be used to generate hypotheses regarding the realized, fundamental, and 'tolerance' niche of species. Although these niche components have rarely been characterized over geographic scales, we suggest that this could be done for many plant species by comparing native, naturalized, and horticultural distributions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We review the statistical ecology and population and range modeling literature, illustrating these modeling strategies in action. A variety of large, coordinated ecological datasets that can feed into these modeling solutions already exist, and we highlight organisms that seem ripe for the challenge.},

We use novel visualization techniques to characterize model response surfaces for several niche modeling algorithms for a virtual species (wherein the truth is known) and for two transfer-based studies published by one of our group. All modeling algorithms for each species showed strict extrapolation, such that biologically unrealistic response surfaces were reconstructed. We discuss the implications of these results for calibration and interpretation of niche models and analysis of ecological niche evolution.

  abstract      = {Large carnivore populations are imperiled worldwide through habitat loss, insufficient prey, and intolerance by people, promoting concerns that their populations will persist only in protected areas and remote regions. This assumption is challenged by recent colonization of areas with high human use in the former ranges of several carnivore species, including cougars (Puma concolor). We hypothesized that cougars adjust their behavior to accommodate anthropogenic development, facilitating successful use of modified habitats. We tested this hypothesis using resource selection functions for 42 individual cougars maintaining home ranges across a gradient of anthropogenic development. We evaluated variation in selection among individual cougars by time of day, home-range location (i.e., rural vs. wilderness cougars), and using functional response curves. Cougars stayed further away from both roads and buildings during the day than they did at night, and wilderness cougars showed stronger avoidance of anthropogenic features than did their rural counterparts. Selection patterns of individual cougars varied greatly, and some of this variation was explained by the functional response. For example, cougars decreased their avoidance of some anthropogenic features as those features became more prevalent on the landscape. Failure to account for potential functional responses in habitat selection could lead to overestimation of negative impacts of development for adaptable large carnivores. Given high adaptability to anthropogenic habitat modification displayed by cougars, cougar persistence in increasingly developed landscapes may depend more on human tolerance than on maintaining large tracts of pristine wilderness. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Cows were examined via transrectal ultrasonography on day 27 or 28 and rectally palpated for pregnancy on days 35 to 41. RESULTS 39{\%} of cows that were pregnant on day 23 lost their embryo by day 27, and 18{\%} of cows that were pregnant on day 27 or 28 were not pregnant on days 35 to 41. Breeding a pregnant cow posed the greatest risk for embryonic loss at both time periods. Mean serum progesterone concentrations on day 21 or 22 and day 23, 24, or 25 were lowest for cows that lost an embryo between days 24 and 28. Cows with a linear somatic cell count score {\textgreater} 4.5 before AI were twice as likely to lose the embryo by 35 to 41 days, compared with cows with a score {\textless} 4.5. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggest that embryonic loss could be reduced by more accurate estrus detection, reducing mastitis, and strategies to improve progesterone concentration after breeding.},

  abstract      = {Species Distribution Models (SDMs) constitute an important tool to assist decision-making in environmental conservation and planning. A popular application of these models is the projection of species distributions under climate change conditions. Yet there are still a range of methodological SDM factors which limit the transferability of these models, contributing significantly to the overall uncertainty of the resulting projections. An important source of uncertainty often neglected in climate change studies comes from the use of background data (a.k.a. pseudo-absences) for model calibration. Here, we study the sensitivity to pseudo-absence sampling as a determinant factor for SDM stability and transferability under climate change conditions, focusing on European wide projections of Quercus robur as an illustrative case study. We explore the uncertainty in future projections derived from ten pseudo-absence realizations and three popular SDMs (GLM, Random Forest and MARS). The contribution of the pseudo-absence realization to the uncertainty was higher in peripheral regions and clearly differed among the tested SDMs in the whole study domain, being MARS the most sensitive — with projections differing up to a 40{\%} for different realizations — and GLM the most stable. As a result we conclude that parsimonious SDMs are preferable in this context, avoiding complex methods (such as MARS) which may exhibit poor model transferability. Accounting for this new source of SDM-dependent uncertainty is crucial when forming multi-model ensembles to undertake climate change projections.},

Resource selection functions (RSFs) estimate the relative amount of time an individual spends using a resource as a function of the proportional availability of that resource. We quantified the association between LRS and coefficients of individual-based RSFs describing lifetime resource selection for 267 female red deer (Cervus elaphus) of the Isle of Rum, Scotland, from 1970 to 2001. LRS was significantly related to first- and second-order effects of selection for Agrostis/Festuca grassland and proximity to the sea coast (quality of forage within Agrostis/Festuca grassland was highest nearest the coast (ratio of short:long grassland)). The benefits of selecting for quality in Agrostis/Festuca grassland, however, traded-off with increases in LRS gained by avoiding conspecific density. LRS was inversely associated with local density, which was highest along the coast, and reproductive benefits of selecting Agrostis/Festuca grassland diminished with increasing density. We discuss the relevance of these results to our understanding of the spatial distribution of red deer abundance, and potential applications of our approach to evolutionary and applied ecology.},

  abstract      = {Environmental changes are expected to alter both the distribution and the abundance of organisms. A disproportionate amount of past work has focused on distribution only, either documenting historical range shifts or predicting future occurrence patterns. However, simultaneous predictions of abundance and distribution across landscapes would be far more useful. To critically assess which approaches represent advances towards the goal of joint predictions of abundance and distribution, we review recent work on changing distributions and on effects of environmental drivers on single populations. Several methods have been used to predict changing distributions. Some of these can be easily modified to also predict abundance, but others cannot. In parallel, demographers have developed a much better understanding of how changing abiotic and biotic drivers will influence growth rate and abundance in single populations. However, this demographic work has rarely taken a landscape perspective and has largely ignored the effects of intraspecific density. We advocate a synthetic approach in which population models accounting for both density dependence and effects of environmental drivers are used to make integrated predictions of equilibrium abundance and distribution across entire landscapes. Such predictions would constitute an important step forward in assessing the ecological consequences of environmental changes.},

  abstract      = {Habitat selection is a fundamental aspect of animal ecology, the understanding of which is critical to management and conservation. Global positioning system data from animals allow fine-scale assessments of habitat selection and typically are analyzed in a use– availability framework, whereby animal locations are contrasted with random locations (the availability sample). Although most use–availability methods are in fact spatial point process models, they often are fit using logistic regression. This framework offers numerous methodological challenges, for which the literature provides little guidance. Specifically, the size and spatial extent of the availability sample influences coefficient estimates potentially causing interpretational bias. We examined the influence of availability on statistical inference through simulations and analysis of serially correlated mule deer GPS data. Bias in estimates arose from incorrectly assessing and sampling the spatial extent of availability. Spatial autocorrelation in covariates, which is common for landscape characteristics, exacerbated the error in availability sampling leading to increased bias. These results have strong implications for habitat selection analyses using GPS data, which are increasingly prevalent in the literature. We recommend that researchers assess the sensitivity of their results to their availability sample and, where bias is likely, take care with interpretations and use cross validation to assess robustness.

Our research took place in boreal forests of northwestern Alberta where we employed radiotelemetry to track wolverine habitat use over three years. We used resource selection functions (used/available design) to analyze wolverine habitat selection patterns during summer and winter seasons. We focused our analyses on the effects of active logging, intermediate-aged cutblocks (11–25 years old), seismic lines, roads, and borrow pits on wolverine habitat selection. Our analysis of active logging used a before, during, interim, and after design. We found wolverines were attracted to logging areas. The strongest selection for logged areas occurred during logging and in the following summer. We suggest logged areas provide foraging opportunities and movement routes for wolverines. Male wolverines were attracted to the edges of intermediate-aged cutblocks (11–25 years old) during summer whereas females were attracted to cutblock edges in winter. However, females avoided intermediate-aged cutblock edges in summer. Moreover, both male and female wolverines avoided the interior of these cutblocks. We would suggest that cutblock edges can provide wolverines with foraging opportunities. We also found wolverines were attracted to seismic lines and borrow pits along roads. Regenerating seismic lines and borrow pits (inhabited by beavers) might offer wolverines foraging opportunities. Our research highlights the need for managers to appreciate the potential for anthropogenic disturbance to either attract or repel wolverines. We warn that attraction of wolverines to industrial features might lead to increased mortality. We also stress that the age of a disturbance can influence its effect on wolverines.},

  abstract      = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. Journal of Applied Ecology published by John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological Society. As part of global efforts to reduce dependence on carbon-based energy sources there has been a rapid increase in the installation of renewable energy devices. The installation and operation of these devices can result in conflicts with wildlife. In the marine environment, mammals may avoid wind farms that are under construction or operating. Such avoidance may lead to more time spent travelling or displacement from key habitats. A paucity of data on at-sea movements of marine mammals around wind farms limits our understanding of the nature of their potential impacts. Here, we present the results of a telemetry study on harbour seals Phoca vitulina in The Wash, south-east England, an area where wind farms are being constructed using impact pile driving. We investigated whether seals avoid wind farms during operation, construction in its entirety, or during piling activity. The study was carried out using historical telemetry data collected prior to any wind farm development and telemetry data collected in 2012 during the construction of one wind farm and the operation of another. Within an operational wind farm, there was a close-to-significant increase in seal usage compared to prior to wind farm development. However, the wind farm was at the edge of a large area of increased usage, so the presence of the wind farm was unlikely to be the cause. There was no significant displacement during construction as a whole. However, during piling, seal usage (abundance) was significantly reduced up to 25 km from the piling activity; within 25 km of the centre of the wind farm, there was a 19 to 83{\%} (95{\%} confidence intervals) decrease in usage compared to during breaks in piling, equating to a mean estimated displacement of 440 individuals. This amounts to significant displacement starting from predicted received levels of between 166 and 178 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa(p-p). Displacement was limited to piling activity; within 2 h of cessation of pile driving, seals were distributed as per the non-piling scenario. Synthesis and applications. Our spatial and temporal quantification of avoidance of wind farms by harbour seals is critical to reduce uncertainty and increase robustness in environmental impact assessments of future developments. Specifically, the results will allow policymakers to produce industry guidance on the likelihood of displacement of seals in response to pile driving; the relationship between sound levels and avoidance rates; and the duration of any avoidance, thus allowing far more accurate environmental assessments to be carried out during the consenting process. Further, our results can be used to inform mitigation strategies in terms of both the sound levels likely to cause displacement and what temporal patterns of piling would minimize the magnitude of the energetic impacts of displacement.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Species distribution modelling has been widely applied in order to assess the potential impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Many methodological decisions, taken during the modelling process and forecasts, may, however, lead to a large variability in the assessment of future impacts. Using measures of species range change and turnover, the potential impacts of climate change on French stream fish species and assemblages were evaluated. Our main focus was to quantify the uncertainty in the projections of these impacts arising from four sources of uncertainty: initial datasets (Data), statistical methods [species distribution models (SDM)], general circulation models (GCM), and gas emission scenarios (GES). Several modalities of the aforementioned uncertainty sources were combined in an ensemble forecasting framework resulting in 8400 different projections. The variance explained by each source was then extracted from this whole ensemble of projections. Overall,SDMcontributed to the largest variation in projections, followed by GCM, whose contribution increased over time equalling almost the proportion of variance explained by SDM in 2080. Data and GES had little influence on the variability in projections. Future projections of range change were more consistent for species with a large geographical extent (i.e., distribution along latitudinal or stream gradients) or with restricted environmental requirements (i.e., small thermal or elevation ranges). Variability in projections of turnover was spatially structured at the scale of France, indicating that certain particular geographical areas should be considered with care when projecting the potential impacts of climate change. The results of this study, therefore, emphasized that particular attention should be paid to the use of predictions ensembles resulting from the application of several statistical methods and climate models. Moreover, forecasted impacts of climate change should always be provided with an assessment of their uncertainty, so that management and conservation decisions can be taken in the full knowledge of their reliability.

In the so-called background pseudo-absences approach, absence locations are simulated in order to obtain a complete sample of the environment. Whilst the commonest approach is random sampling of the entire study region, in its multiple variants, its performance may not be optimal, and the method of generation of pseudo-absences is known to have a significant influence on the results obtained. Here, we compare a suite of classic (random sampling) and novel methods for pseudo-absence data generation and propose a generalizable three-step method combining environmental profiling with a new technique for background extent restriction. To this aim, we consider 11 phylogenetic groups of Oak (. Quercus sp.) described in Europe. We evaluate the influence of different pseudo-absence types on model performance (area under the ROC curve), calibration (reliability diagrams) and the resulting suitability maps, using a cross-validation approach. Regardless of the modelling algorithm used, random-sampling models were outperformed by the methods that incorporate environmental profiling of the background, stressing the importance of the pseudo-absence generation techniques for the development of accurate and reliable SDMs. We also provide an integrated modelling framework implementing the methods tested in a software package for the open source R environment.},

Such projections are highly disconcerting. Yet, considerable variation can occur in the direction and magnitude of range changes projected by different SDM methods, even when predictive performance is similar. In this study, we assessed whether particular methods have a tendency to predict substantial loss or gain of suitable habitat. In particular, we asked, “are 14 SDM methods equally likely to predict extreme changes to the future extent of suitable habitat for 220 Australian mammal species?”. We defined five non-mutually exclusive categories of ‘extreme' change, based on stability or loss of current habitat, or the dislocation of current and future habitat: a) no future habitat (range extinction); b) low stability of current habitat (≤10{\%} remains); c) no gain of habitat in new locations; d) all future habitat is in new locations (i.e. completely displaced from current habitat); and e) substantial increase in size of habitat (future habitat is ≥100{\%} larger than current). We found that some SDM methods were significantly more likely than others to predict extreme changes. In particular, distance-based models were significantly less likely than other methods to predict substantial increases in habitat size; Random Forest models and Surface Range Envelopes were significantly more likely to predict a complete loss of current habitat, and future range extinction. Generalised Additive Models and Generalised Linear Models rarely predicted range extinction; future habitat completely disjunct from current habitat was predicted more frequently than expected by Classification Tree Analysis and less frequently by Maxent. Random Forest generally predicted extreme range changes more frequently than other SDM methods. Our results identify trends among different methods with respect to tendency to predict extreme range changes. These are of significance for climate-impact assessments, with implications for transferability of models to novel environments. Our findings emphasise the need to explore and justify the use of different models and their parameterisations, and to develop approaches to assist with optimisation of models.},

Range-shifting species pose a challenge for traditional correlative approaches to range prediction, often requiring the extrapolation of complex statistical associations into novel environmental space. Here we take an alternative approach that does not use species occurrence data, but instead captures the fundamental niche of a species by mechanistically linking key organismal traits with spatial data using biophysical models. We demonstrate this approach with a major invasive species, the cane toad Bufo marinus in Australia, assessing the direct climatic constraints on its ability to move, survive, and reproduce. We show that the current range can be explained by thermal constraints on the locomotor potential of the adult stage together with limitations on the availability of water for the larval stage. Our analysis provides a framework for biologically grounded predictions of the potential for cane toads to expand their range under current and future climate scenarios. More generally, by quantifying spatial variation in physiological constraints on an organism, trait-based approaches can be used to investigate the range-limits of any species. Assessments of spatial variation in the physiological constraints on an organism may also provide a mechanistic basis for forecasting the rate of range expansion and for understanding a species' potential to evolve at range-edges. Mechanistic approaches thus have broad application to process-based ecological and evolutionary models of range-shift.},

A species ecological niche determines its geographic distribution, and species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to predict them. For various reasons, e.g. the lack of spatial data on relevant environmental factors, SDMs fail to characterize important ecological relationships. We argue that SDMs do not yet include relevant environmental information, which can be measured with remote sensing (RS). RS may benefit SDMs because it provides information on e.g. ecosystem function, health and structure, complete spatial assessment and reasonable temporal repeat for the processes that determine geographical distributions. However, RS data is still seldom included in such studies with the exception of climate data. Here we provide a guide for researchers aiming to improve their SDM studies, describing how they might include RS data in their specific study. We propose how to improve models of species ecological niches, by including measures of habitat quality (e.g. productivity), nutritional values, and seasonal or life-cycle events. To date, several studies have shown that using ecologically-relevant environmental predictors derived from RS improve model performance and transferability, and better approximate a species ecological niche. These data, however, are not a panacea for SDMs, as there are cases in which RS predictors are not appropriate, too costly, or exhibit low predictive power. The integration of multiple environmental predictors derived from RS in SDMs can thus improve our knowledge on processes driving biodiversity change and improve our capacity for biodiversity conservation.},

  abstract      = {Resource selection functions (RSFs) are typically estimated by comparing covariates at a discrete set of "used" locations to those from an "available" set of locations. This RSF approach treats the response as binary and does not account for intensity of use among habitat units where locations were recorded. Advances in global positioning system (GPS) technology allow animal location data to be collected at fine spatiotemporal scales and have increased the size and correlation of data used in RSF analyses. We suggest that a more contemporary approach to analyzing such data is to model intensity of use, which can be estimated for one or more animals by relating the relative frequency of locations in a set of sampling units to the habitat characteristics of those units with count-based regression and, in particular, negative binomial (NB) regression. We demonstrate this NB RSF approach with location data collected from 10 GPS-collared Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range enclosure. We discuss modeling assumptions and show how RSF estimation with NB regression can easily accommodate contemporary research needs, including: analysis of large GPS data sets, computational ease, accounting for among-animal variation, and interpretation of model covariates. We recommend the NB approach because of its conceptual and computational simplicity, and the fact that estimates of intensity of use are unbiased in the face of temporally correlated animal location data.},

  abstract      = {* Disease models typically focus on temporal dynamics of infection, while often neglecting environmental processes that determine host movement. In many systems, however, temporal disease dynamics may be slow compared to the scale at which environmental conditions alter host space-use and accelerate disease transmission. * Using a mechanistic movement modelling approach, we made space-use predictions of a mobile host (elk [Cervus Canadensis] carrying the bacterial disease brucellosis) under environmental conditions that change daily and annually (e.g., plant phenology, snow depth), and we used these predictions to infer how spring phenology influences the risk of brucellosis transmission from elk (through aborted foetuses) to livestock in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. * Using data from 288 female elk monitored with GPS collars, we fit step selection functions (SSFs) during the spring abortion season and then implemented a master equation approach to translate SSFs into predictions of daily elk distribution for five plausible winter weather scenarios (from a heavy snow, to an extreme winter drought year). We predicted abortion events by combining elk distributions with empirical estimates of daily abortion rates, spatially varying elk seroprevelance and elk population counts. * Our results reveal strong spatial variation in disease transmission risk at daily and annual scales that is strongly governed by variation in host movement in response to spring phenology. For example, in comparison with an average snow year, years with early snowmelt are predicted to have 64{\%} of the abortions occurring on feedgrounds shift to occurring on mainly public lands, and to a lesser extent on private lands. * Synthesis and applications. Linking mechanistic models of host movement with disease dynamics leads to a novel bridge between movement and disease ecology. Our analysis framework offers new avenues for predicting disease spread, while providing managers tools to proactively mitigate risks posed by mobile disease hosts. More broadly, we demonstrate how mechanistic movement models can provide predictions of ecological conditions that are consistent with climate change but may be more extreme than has been observed historically.},

  abstract      = {Like most aspects of ecology, the process of habitat or resource selection scales in space as well as time. However, scaling questions have generally focused on extent including size of study area and home ranges that dictate availability of resources. Grain of analysis (size of resource units used) is generally restricted to questions of methodology as opposed to functional ecology. Most often, grain is adopted as a point, unit, or patch that is common in size to all habitat resources used and available; however, in the process of habitat selection, it is feasible that individual animals may opt to select for different resources at different grains. For example, animals may use units of vegetation association at a finer grain when feeding or resting compared to when moving through habitat. Here we introduce and evaluate the 'multi-grain resource selection function', or MRSF. We generated MRSFs for a case study of GPS-collared white-tailed deer (. Odocoileus virginianus; n=. 14) at Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, Canada. We created models across two seasons and extents and varied the radius around used and available points within which resource types were measured, and compared models to evaluate the relative importance of resource variables at different grains. We hypothesized that resource selection would vary with grain and that RSFs computed using multiple grains would be more predictive than models computed using a single grain as they better incorporate the space of influence on decision making in different habitat areas. We found that models of animals using grains of different sizes for different resource types were characterized by comparatively lower AIC scores. We conclude that scaling grain can and should be considered in models of resource selection, and that animals make decisions on resource selection at multiple grains. The MRSF, like analyses incorporating individual effects, density dependence, and functional responses, brings us closer to incorporating process, rather than only patterns, into the study of resource and habitat selection.},

  abstract      = {Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are often used to predict the potential range of invasive species. Unfortunately, most studies do not evaluate variables relevance before selecting them to fit their models. Moreover, multiple variables such as climate and land use may drive species distribution at different spatial scales but most studies either use a single type of drivers, or combine multiple types without respecting their operating scale. We propose a three steps framework to overcome this limitation. First, use SDMs to select the most relevant climatic variables to predict a given species distribution, at continental scale. Then, characterize the species-habitat relationships, at a local scale, to produce species and area specific habitat filters. Finally, combine both information, each obtained at a relevant scale, to refine climatic predictions according to habitat suitability. We illustrate this framework with 14,794 Asian hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) records. We show that integrating multiple drivers, while still respecting their scale of effect, produced a potential range 55.9{\%} smaller than that predicted using the climatic model alone, suggesting a systematic overestimation in many published predictions. This general framework illustrated by a well-documented invasive species is applicable to other taxa and scenarios of future climate and land-cover changes.},

  abstract      = {Environmental change is expected to shift the geographic range of species and communities. To estimate the consequences of these shifts for the functioning and stability of ecosystems, reliable predictions of alterations in species distributions are needed. Projections with correlative species distribution models, which correlate species' distributions to the abiotic environment, have become a standard approach. Criticism of this approach centres around the omission of relevant biotic feedbacks and triggered the search for alternatives. A new generation of mechanistic process-based species distribution models aims at implementing formulations of relevant biotic processes to cover species' life histories, physiology, dispersal abilities, evolution, and both intra- and interspecific interactions. Although this step towards more structural realism is considered important, it remains unclear whether the resulting projections are more reliable. Structural realism has the advantage that geographic range shifting emerges from the interplay of relevant abiotic and biotic processes. Having implemented the relevant response mechanisms, structural realistic models should better tackle the challenge of generating projections of species responses to (non-analogous) environmental change. However, reliable projections of future species ranges demand ecological information that is currently only available for few species. In this opinion paper, we discuss how the discrepancy between demand for structural realism on the one hand and the related knowledge gaps on the other hand affects the reliability of mechanistic species distribution models. We argue that omission of relevant processes potentially impairs projection accuracy (proximity of the mean outcome to the true value), particularly if species range shifts emerge from species and community dynamics. Yet, insufficient knowledge that limits model specification and parameterization, as well as process complexity, increases projection uncertainty (variance in the outcome of simulated model projections). The accuracy-uncertainty-relation reflects current limits to delivering reliable projections of range shifts. We propose a protocol to improve and communicate projection reliability. The protocol combines modelling and empirical research to efficiently fill critical knowledge gaps that currently limit the reliability of species and community projections.},

The hypothesis was promoted to identify locations and interventions most likely to benefit declining species. We used a niche reduction approach to species distribution modelling by predicting the historic and current distributions of a critically endangered Australian rodent, the central rock-rat (CRR). Our habitat suitability maps confirm a dramatic range contraction for this species over the last 100 years. The current association of CRRs with extreme landscape ruggedness supports the hypothesis that the impact of a key threat to the species—cat predation—is mediated by habitat complexity. We detected no CRRs in five new locations predicted to be highly suitable in the current distribution model. This highlights the need for in-situ threat management at the three known sub-populations, one of which may already have been extirpated. Our map of the CRR's historic distribution identifies potential areas for translocation, including the site of a current translocation proposal into a predator-proof fence. We conclude that the NRH provides a useful framework for modelling the change in distributions of declining species in order to prioritise locations and interventions for management.},

  abstract      = {Characterising a species' geographical extent is central to many conservation assessments, including those of the IUCN Red List of threatened species. The IUCN recommends that extent of occurrence (EOO) to be quantified by drawing a minimum convex polygon (MCP) around known or inferred presence localities. EOO calculated from verified specimens is commonly used in Red List assessments when other data are scarce, as is the case for many threatened plant species. Yet rarely do these estimates incorporate inferred localities from species distribution models (SDMs). A key impediment stems from uncertainty about how SDM predictions relate to EOO. Here we address this issue by comparing the EOOs estimated from specimen localities with EOOs derived from SDMs for plant species occurring in Costa Rica and Panama. We first analyse 20 plant species, with well-known and well-sampled distributions, and train SDMs to subsamples of the data and assess how well the SDM-derived MCPs predict both the MCPs of the subsamples and the MCPs of the complete dataset. We find that when sample sizes are small (5 or 10 samples) the SDM-derived MCPs are actually closer to the complete dataset than to the MCPs of the subsamples, both in terms of EOO and geographically. This occurs when using a probability threshold based on maximum geographical similarity between the SDM-derived MCP and the subsample MCP; other threshold methods performed less well. For the species with less well-known distributions, the SDM-derived EOOs correlate strongly with, but tend to be larger than, EOOs estimated by point data. This implies that a SDM-derived EOO may be more representative of the full EOO than that drawn around known localities. Our findings reveal situations in which SDMs provide useful information that complements the IUCN Red Listing process. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

We investigated the degree to which two-lane highways were permeable to movements of resident Canada lynx in the Southern Rocky Mountains based on highway crossings (n = 593) documented with GPS telemetry. All lynx crossed highways when present in home ranges at an average rate of 0.6 crossings per day. Lynx mostly crossed highways during the night and early dawn when traffic volumes were low. Five of 13 lynx crossed highways less frequently than expected when compared to random expectation, but even these individuals crossed highways frequently in parts of their home range. We developed fine- and landscape-scale resource selection function (RSF) models with field and remotely sensed data, respectively. At the fine scale, lynx selected crossings with low distances to vegetative cover and higher tree basal area; we found no support that topography or road infrastructure affected lynx crossing. At the landscape scale, lynx crossed highways in areas with high forest canopy cover in drainages on primarily north-facing aspects. The predicted crossing probabilities generated from the landscape-scale RSF model across western Colorado, USA, were successful in identifying known lynx crossing sites as documented with independent snow-tracking and road-mortality data.

  abstract      = {How complex does a model need to be to provide useful predictions is a matter of continuous debate across environmental sciences. In the species distributions modelling literature, studies have demonstrated that more complex models tend to provide better fits. However, studies have also shown that predictive performance does not always increase with complexity. Testing of species distributions models is challenging because independent data for testing are often lacking, but a more general problem is that model complexity has never been formally described in such studies. Here, we systematically examine predictive performance of models against data and models of varying complexity. We introduce the concept of computational complexity, widely used in theoretical computer sciences, to quantify model complexity. In addition, complexity of species distributional data is characterized by their geometrical properties. Tests involved analysis of models' ability to predict virtual species distributions in the same region and the same time as used for training the models, and to project distributions in different times under climate change. Of the eight species distribution models analyzed five (Random Forest, boosted regression trees, generalized additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, MaxEnt) showed similar performance despite differences in computational complexity. The ability of models to forecast distributions under climate change was also not affected by model complexity. In contrast, geometrical characteristics of the data were related to model performance in several ways: complex datasets were consistently more difficult to model, and the complexity of the data was affected by the choice of predictors and the type of data analyzed. Given our definition of complexity, our study contradicts the widely held view that the complexity of species distributions models has significant effects in their predictive ability while findings support for previous observations that the properties of species distributions data and their relationship with the environment are strong predictors of model success.},

  abstract      = {Recent studies suggest that species distribution models (SDMs) based on fine-scale climate data may provide markedly different estimates of climate-change impacts than coarse-scale models. However, these studies disagree in their conclusions of how scale influences projected species distributions. In rugged terrain, coarse-scale climate grids may not capture topographically controlled climate variation at the scale that constitutes microhabitat or refugia for some species. Although finer scale data are therefore considered to better reflect climatic conditions experienced by species, there have been few formal analyses of how modeled distributions differ with scale. We modeled distributions for 52 plant species endemic to the California Floristic Province of different life forms and range sizes under recent and future climate across a 2000-fold range of spatial scales (0.008-16 km(2) ). We produced unique current and future climate datasets by separately downscaling 4 km climate models to three finer resolutions based on 800, 270, and 90 m digital elevation models and deriving bioclimatic predictors from them. As climate-data resolution became coarser, SDMs predicted larger habitat area with diminishing spatial congruence between fine- and coarse-scale predictions. These trends were most pronounced at the coarsest resolutions and depended on climate scenario and species' range size. On average, SDMs projected onto 4 km climate data predicted 42{\%} more stable habitat (the amount of spatial overlap between predicted current and future climatically suitable habitat) compared with 800 m data. We found only modest agreement between areas predicted to be stable by 90 m models generalized to 4 km grids compared with areas classified as stable based on 4 km models, suggesting that some climate refugia captured at finer scales may be missed using coarser scale data. These differences in projected locations of habitat change may have more serious implications than net habitat area when predictive maps form the basis of conservation decision making.},

  abstract      = {Understanding habitat selection is of primary interest in theoretical and ap- plied ecology. One approach is to infer habitat selection processes from differences in population densities between habitats using methods such as isodar and isoleg analysis. Another approach is to directly observe the movements of individuals. However, habitat selection models based on movement data often fail to adequately incorporate spatial pro- cesses. This is problematic if the probability of selecting a particular habitat is dependent upon its spatial context. This would occur, for example, where organisms exhibit home range behavior and the choice of habitat is dependent on its location relative to the home range. In this paper we present a spatially explicit habitat selection model for movement data that incorporates home range behavior as a spatial process. Our approach extends a previous model by formulating the probability of selecting a habitat as a function of its distance from the animal's current location and home range center. We demonstrate that these enhancements lead to more parsimonious models when applied to a koala radio- tracking data set from eastern Australia. This approach could also be applied to modeling other spatial habitat selection processes, leading to more biologically meaningful models for a range of species and applications.},

Presence data combined with background or pseudo-absence locations are commonly used with species distribution modeling to develop these relationships. However, there is not a standard method to generate background or pseudo-absence locations, and method choice affects model outcomes. We evaluated combinations of both model algorithms (simple and complex generalized linear models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, Maxent, boosted regression trees, and random forest) and background methods (random, minimum convex polygon, and continuous and binary kernel density estimator (KDE)) to assess the sensitivity of model outcomes to choices made. We evaluated six questions related to model results, including five beyond the common comparison of model accuracy assessment metrics (biological interpretability of response curves, cross-validation robustness, independent data accuracy and robustness, and prediction consistency). For our case study with cheatgrass in the western US, random forest was least sensitive to background choice and the binary KDE method was least sensitive to model algorithm choice. While this outcome may not hold for other locations or species, the methods we used can be implemented to help determine appropriate methodologies for particular research questions.},

Wildlife telemetry technology coupled with the availability of spatial data and GIS software have facilitated advancements in species distribution modeling. There are also challenges related to these advancements including the accurate and appropriate implementation of species distribution modeling methodology. Resource Selection Function (RSF) modeling is a commonly used approach for understanding species distributions and habitat usage, and mapping the RSF results can enhance study findings and make them more accessible to researchers and wildlife managers. Currently, there is no consensus in the literature on the most appropriate method for mapping RSF results, methods are frequently not described, and mapping approaches are not always related to accuracy metrics. We conducted a systematic review of the RSF literature to summarize the methods used to map RSF outputs, discuss the relationship between mapping approaches and accuracy metrics, performed a case study on the implications of employing different mapping methods, and provide recommendations as to appropriate mapping techniques for RSF studies. We found extensive variability in methodology for mapping RSF results. Our case study revealed that the most commonly used approaches for mapping RSF results led to notable differences in the visual interpretation of RSF results, and there is a concerning disconnect between accuracy metrics and mapping methods. We make 5 recommendations for researchers mapping the results of RSF studies, which are focused on carefully selecting and describing the method used to map RSF studies, and relating mapping approaches to accuracy metrics.},

  abstract      = {Sustainable management strategies for tropical forest ecosystems require a detailed understanding of the distribution of tropical forest species, limitations on distribution, as well as occurrence patterns in the absence of limitations. In the Americas, many tropical palms (Arecaceae) are locally abundant keystone species that provide a number of non-timber forest products. Here we focus on 10 such species (Aphandra natalia, Attalea phalerata, Euterpe oleracea, Iriartea deltoidea, Mauritia flexousa, Oenocarpus bataua, Phytelephas aequatorialis, Phytelephas macrocarpa, and Phytelephas seemannii) found in western South America. This study aimed to determine: (i) what variables control potential species distribution, (ii) whether their distribution is spatially constrained and if so, (iii) how their potential ranges compare to their actual ranges. We built species distribution models using Maxent software with three groups of predictor variables: C (climatic), N (non-climatic environmental), S (spatial), and combinations thereof: C, CN and CNS. The CNS predictor variable combination gave superior predictive ability based on median Area Under the Curve (AUC) values and was consistent with available range maps. In contrast, individual C and CN predictor variables gave inferior AUC values and showed less similarity to range maps. We concluded that the CNS model that combined climatic, non-climatic, and spatial variables best represented the actual distribution of the 10 palm species, whereas C and CN models approached their potential distribution. Precipitation during the driest quarter and annual precipitation were the most important predictors of the potential distribution, whereas temperature of the coldest month, soil, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were less important. We found that the actual distributions of palm species were spatially constrained, and that the spatial variables largely coincided with the dispersal barriers of the Andean Cordillera and past climatic fluctuations. The estimated potential range varied from nearly equal to the actual range, to up to 0.55×106km2 (55.1×106ha) larger than the actual range, depending on model, threshold settings, and species. We thus concluded that current palm resources in the forests of western South America have major potential for ecological expansion. These results are relevant to current palm management and resource conservation planning, as well as future strategies that will have to address climate change and increasing human disturbance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Species distribution models (SDMs) based on current ecological niche constraints are used to project future species distributions. These models contain assumptions that add to the uncertainty in model projections stemming from the structure of the models, the algorithms used to translate niche associations into distributional probabilities, the quality and quantity of data, and mismatches between the scales of modeling and data. We illustrate the application of SDMs using two climate models and two distributional algorithms, together with information on distributional shifts in vegetation types, to project fine-scale future distributions of 60 California landbird species. Most species are projected to decrease in distribution by 2070. Changes in total species richness vary over the state, with large losses of species in some “hotspots” of vulnerability. Differences in distributional shifts among species will change species co-occurrences, creating spatial variation in similarities between current and future assemblages. We use these analyses to consider how assumptions can be addressed and uncertainties reduced. SDMs can provide a useful way to incorporate future conditions into conservation and management practices and decisions, but the uncertainties of model projections must be balanced with the risks of taking the wrong actions or the costs of inaction. Doing this will require that the sources and magnitudes of uncertainty are documented, and that conservationists and resource managers be willing to act despite the uncertainties. The alternative, of ignoring the future, is not an option.},

However, habitat selection does not necessarily equate to habitat quality particularly if selection is maladaptive, so incorporating measures of fitness into estimations of occurrence is necessary to increase model robustness. Here, we incorporated spatially explicit mortality events with the habitat selection of elephants to predict secure and risky habitats in northern Botswana. Following a two-step approach, we first predict the relative probability of use and the relative probability of mortality based on landscape features using logistic regression models. Combining these two indices, we then identified low mortality and high use (primary habitat) and areas of high mortality and high use (primary risk). We found that mortalities of adult elephants were closely associated with anthropogenic features, with 80{\%} of mortalities occurring within 25. km of people. Conversely, elephant habitat selection was highest at distances of 30-50. km from people. Primary habitat for elephants occurred in the central portion of the study area and within the Okavango Delta; whereas risky areas occurred along the periphery near humans. The protected designation of an area had less influence on the proportion of prime habitat therein than did the locations of the area in relation to human development. Elephant management in southern Africa is moving towards a more self-sustaining, habitat-based approach, and information on selection and mortality could serve as a baseline to help identify demographic sources and sinks to stabilize elephant demography. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Improved SDMs, which account for biotic factors and do not require a priori knowledge on species interactions, are needed to fully understand species distributions. Here, we model the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on species distribution patterns and explore the robustness of distributions under future climate change. We fit hierarchical spatial models using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) for lagomorph species throughout Europe and test the predictive ability of models containing only abiotic factors against models containing abiotic and biotic factors. We account for residual spatial autocorrelation using a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model. Model outputs are used to estimate areas in which abiotic and biotic factors determine species' ranges. INLA models containing both abiotic and biotic factors had substantially better predictive ability than models containing abiotic factors only, for all but one of the four species. In models containing abiotic and biotic factors, both appeared equally important as determinants of lagomorph ranges, but the influences were spatially heterogeneous. Parts of widespread lagomorph ranges highly influenced by biotic factors will be less robust to future changes in climate, whereas parts of more localised species ranges highly influenced by the environment may be less robust to future climate. SDMs that do not explicitly include biotic factors are potentially misleading and omit a very important source of variation. For the field of species distribution modelling to advance, biotic factors must be taken into account in order to improve the reliability of predicting species distribution patterns both presently and under future climate change.},

These methods have led to considerable new insights, but they often fail to account for the effects of historical biogeography on present-day species distributions. Because the geography of speciation can lead to patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the distributions of species within a clade, this can result in misleading inferences about the importance of deterministic processes in generating spatial patterns of biodiversity. In this opinion article, we discuss ways in which patterns of species distributions driven by historical biogeography are often interpreted as evidence of particular evolutionary or ecological processes. We focus on three areas that are especially prone to such misinterpretations: community phylogenetics, environmental niche modelling, and analyses of beta diversity (compositional turnover of biodiversity).},

Here we present a general model for estimating potential habitat quality (relating to growth and reproduction) and realised habitat quality (accounting for survival) using basic knowledge of the species' seasonal diet, predicted locations of food resource patches and regional patterns in mortality risk. We illustrate our model for a threatened population of grizzly bears in west-central Alberta. Bi-monthly potential habitat quality successfully predicted habitat selection by radio-collared grizzly bears, while multi-seasonal realised habitat quality predicted patterns in occupancy-abundance as measured from unique bears at hair-snag sites. Bottom-up resources therefore predicted patterns of habitat selection, while top-down processes (survival) were necessary to scale-up to population measures. We suggest that more direct measures of resources and environments that affect growth, reproduction and survival, as well as match the temporal scale of animal behaviour, be considered when developing wildlife habitat models. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract      = {Owing to the conceptual complexity of functional diversity (FD), a multitude of different methods are available for measuring it, with most being operational at only a small range of spatial scales. This causes uncertainty in ecological interpretations and limits the potential to generalize findings across studies or compare patterns across scales. We solve this problem by providing a unified framework expanding on and integrating existing approaches. The framework, based on trait probability density (TPD), is the first to fully implement the Hutchinsonian concept of the niche as a probabilistic hypervolume in estimating FD. This novel approach could revolutionize FD-based research by allowing quantification of the various FD components from organismal to macroecological scales, and allowing seamless transitions between scales. Functional trait diversity, in other words the variation of traits between organisms, can be used to address a great number of pressing ecological questions. Consequently, trait-based approaches are increasingly being used by ecologists.However, functional diversity comprises several components that can be evaluated at different spatial scales. Because of this conceptual complexity, there is an overabundance of disparate approaches for estimating it, which leads to confusion among users and hampers the comparability of different studies.A single mathematical framework encompassing different approaches while providing a seamless continuity between spatial scales is needed.Reconciling the approaches based on the concept of the niche as a hypervolume and those that consider traits in probabilistic terms is the first step towards the foundation of a unified framework.},

In this review, I examine evidence for the occurrence of site familiarity and its fitness benefits, describe the difficulty of measuring site familiarity, note its omission from the influential ideal free and ideal despotic models, and use a literature search to test an assumption of the ideal models that has become widespread in habitat selection theory: that animals behave without regard for site familiarity. I find little support for such “familiarity blindness” in vertebrates. Next I discuss how the study of public information has drawn attention away from site familiarity and point out that both kinds of information are likely to be important in habitat selection. I proceed to examine current models of initial settlement (exploration and settlement of prebreeders on first territories) and optional resettlement (site fidelity or dispersal by established breeders following a period of prospecting) and find that the latter include only basic forms of site familiarity. Hence, I develop the concept that an inhabited space holds a unique “private value” to an animal based on its familiarity with the space and offer a simple model for optional resettlement based on private value that generates several novel predictions, including site fidelity based on cumulative breeding site familiarity and high site fidelity among species with complex territories.},

However, many commonly used approaches to identify important habitats do not provide direct insight into the contribution of those habitats to population persistence. To assess how habitats contribute to overall population viability and characterize their relative importance, a spatially-explicit population viability model was used to integrate a species occurrence model with habitat quality and demographic information to simulate the population dynamics of the Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii) in Alberta, Canada. Long-term productivity (births-deaths) in each patch was simulated and iterative patch removal experiments were conducted to generate estimates of the relative contribution of habitat types to overall population viability. Our results indicated that natural dune habitats are crucial for population viability, while disturbed/human-created habitats make a minor contribution to population persistence. The results also suggest that the habitats currently available to Ord's kangaroo rats in Alberta are unlikely to support long-term persistence. Our approach was useful for identifying habitats that did not contribute to population viability. A large proportion of habitat (39{\%}) represented sinks and their removal increased estimated population viability. The integration of population dynamics with habitat quality and occurrence data can be invaluable when assessing critical habitat, particularly in regions with variable habitat quality. Approaches that do not incorporate population dynamics may undermine conservation efforts by under- or over-estimating the value of habitats, erroneously protecting sink habitats, or failing to prioritize key source habitats. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this analysis, we explore implications of different configurations of major factors that constrain species' distributions-abiotic factors and dispersal limitation-for the success or failure of these models. We analyze variation in performance among modeling approaches as a function of the relative configuration of these two factors and the spatial extent of training region, with the result that a clear understanding of the abiotic-dispersal configuration is a prerequisite to effective model implementations; the effects of spatial extent of the training region are less consistent and clear. Model development will be powerful only when set in an appropriate and explicit biogeographic and population ecological context. {\textcopyright} 2012 .},

In the conterminous United States, Canada lynx Lynx canadensis is a federally threatened boreal species that may require connectivity with northern populations to persist. Connectivity is a function of movement between patches and the likelihood that patches are suitable for resident populations. Therefore, we combined resource selection, step selection, and least-cost path models to define empirically movement corridors for lynx in the Northern Rocky Mountains. We used telemetry data for 64 lynx monitored during 1998-2007 to create a broad-scale resource selection model that predicted probable lynx habitat across the species' distribution in the Northern Rocky Mountains. Our model indicated that lynx selected home ranges at mid-elevations with low surface roughness and high canopy cover. Based on a subset of 37 (16 females, 21 males) adult lynx fitted with GPS collars from 2005 to 2007, we then tested the extent to which remotely-sensed indices of environmental heterogeneity, including greenness, normalized difference vegetation index, surface roughness, and a principal component that indexed stand age, could characterize landscape connectivity for lynx. We found that connectivity between lynx habitat in Canada and that in the conterminous US is facilitated by only a few putative corridors that extend south from the international border. Maintaining the integrity of these connectivity corridors is of primary importance to lynx conservation in the Northern Rockies. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

  abstract      = {In this paper we explore new options for model selection in the distribution modelling method MaxEnt, offered by the strict maximum likelihood explanation of the method. These options, which are collectively referred to as the 'alternative MaxEnt procedure' (aMp), imply manual forward stepwise selection of variables and an F-ratio test to compare nested models. We compared aMp models with models obtained by the default variable transformation and model selection procedures in the popular Maxent.jar software ('default MaxEnt procedure'; dMp), which invokes ℓ1-regularisation. We used swamp-forest presence in SE Norway as the target for our modelling. Eleven terrain variables derived from a LiDAR-based digital elevation map, making up three groups of internally correlated variables, were used as predictors in the models. An independently collected presence/absence 'test' data set was used for evaluation of models. Although dMp models were much more complex than aMp models, with up to 240 variables derived from the original 11, compared to a maximum number of derived variables in aMp models of 14, no significant difference in performance between dMp and aMp models was found. This indicates that the regularisation procedure is not the main reason for the good performance of MaxEnt (as implemented in Maxent.jar) in comparative studies. Advantages of the more flexible aMp procedure, which produces simpler models, are discussed. Effects of spatial autocorrelation in the response variable on modelling results were addressed by obtaining parallel MaxEnt models for two response variables that differ in the number of presence observations: the centroid of the 121 swamp forests and the 7175 grid cells, each 5 m × 5 m, in which swamp forest was recorded as present. Our results are not conclusive with respect to the effect of spatial autocorrelation in the response variable on the predictive performance of distribution models by MaxEnt.},

Developing RSFs using data from GPS telemetry can be problematic due to serial autocorrelation, but modern analytical techniques can help to compensate for this correlation. 2. We used telemetry locations from 18 woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou in Saskatchewan, Canada, to compare marginal (population-specific) generalized estimating equations (GEEs), and conditional (subject-specific) generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs), for developing resource selection functions at two spatial scales. We evaluated the use of empirical standard errors, which are robust to misspecification of the correlation structure. We compared these approaches with destructive sampling. 3. Statistical significance was strongly influenced by the use of empirical vs. model-based standard errors, and marginal (GEE) and conditional (GLMM) results differed. Destructive sampling reduced apparent habitat selection. k -fold cross-validation results differed for GEE and GLMM, as it must be applied differently for each model. 4. Synthesis and applications . Due to their different interpretations, marginal models (e.g. generalized estimating equations, GEEs) may be better for landscape and population management, while conditional models (e.g. generalized linear mixed-effects models, GLMMs) may be better for management of endangered species and individuals. Destructive sampling may lead to inaccurate resource selection functions (RSFs), but GEEs and GLMMs can be used for developing RSFs when used with empirical standard errors.},

  abstract      = {The lack of comprehensive sighting data sets precludes the application of standard habitat suitability modeling approaches to predict distributions of the majority of marine mammal species on very large scales. As an alternative, we developed an ecological niche model to map global distributions of 115 cetacean and pinniped species living in the marine environment using more readily available expert knowledge about habitat usage. We started by assigning each species to broad-scale niche categories with respect to depth, sea-surface temperature, and ice edge association based on synopses of published information. Within a global information system framework and a global grid of 0.5° latitude/longitude cell dimensions, we then generated an index of the relative environmental suitability (RES) of each cell for a given species by relating known habitat usage to local environmental conditions. RES predictions closely matched published maximum ranges for most species, thus representing useful, more objective alternatives to existing sketched distributional outlines. In addition, raster-based predictions provided detailed information about heterogeneous patterns of potentially suitable habitat for species throughout their range. We tested RES model outputs for 11 species (northern fur seal, harbor porpoise, sperm whale, killer whale, hourglass dolphin, fin whale, humpback whale, blue whale, Antarctic minke, and dwarf minke whales) from a broad taxonomic and geographic range, using data from dedicated surveys. Observed encounter rates and species-specific predicted environmental suitability were significantly and positively correlated for all but 1 species. In comparison, encounter rates were correlated with {\textless}1{\%} of 1000 simulated random data sets for all but 2 species. Mapping of large-scale marine mammal distributions using this environmental envelope model is helpful for evaluating current assumptions and knowledge about species' occurrences, especially for data-poor species. Moreover, RES modeling can help to focus research efforts on smaller geographic scales and usefully supplement other, statistical, habitat suitability models.},

Discrete-time hidden Markov models (HMMs) achieve considerable computational gains by focusing on observations that are regularly spaced in time, and for which the measurement error is negligible. These conditions are often met, in particular for data related to terrestrial animals, so that a likelihood-based HMM approach is feasible. We describe a number of extensions of HMMs for animal movement modeling, including more flexible state transition models and individual random effects (fitted in a non-Bayesian framework). In particular we consider so-called hidden semi-Markov models, which may substantially improve the goodness of fit and provide important insights into the behavioral state switching dynamics. To showcase the expediency of these methods, we consider an application of a hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model to multiple bison movement paths.},

A modelling procedure is needed that gets the gist of the environmental descriptors of a distribution area, without either overfitting to the training data or overestimating the species' distribution potential. We tested the transferability power of the favourability function, a generalized linear model, on the distribution of the Iberian desman (Galemys pyrenaicus) in the Iberian territories of Portugal and Spain. We also tested the effects of two of the main potential constraints on model transferability: the analysed ranges of the predictor variables, and the completeness of the species distribution data. We modelled 10 km × 10 km presence/absence data from Portugal and Spain separately, extrapolated each model to the other country, and compared predictions with observations. The Spanish model, despite arguably containing more false absences, showed good predictive ability in Portugal. The Portuguese model, whose predictors ranged between only a subset of the values observed in Spain, overestimated desman distribution when transferred. We discuss possible reasons for this differential model behaviour, and highlight the importance of this kind of models for prediction and conservation applications. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, these intuitive distinctions can become blurred when comparing species distribution modelling approaches in more detail. In this review article, we contrast the extremes of the correlative–process spectrum of species distribution models with respect to core assumptions, model building and selection strategies, validation, uncertainties, common errors and the questions they are most suited to answer. The extremes of such approaches differ clearly in many aspects, such as model building approaches, parameter estimation strategies and transferability. However, they also share strengths and weaknesses. We show that claims of one approach being intrinsically superior to the other are misguided and that they ignore the process–correlation continuum as well as the domains of questions that each approach is addressing. Nonetheless, the application of process-based approaches to species distribution modelling lags far behind more correlative (process-implicit) methods and more research is required to explore their potential benefits. Critical issues for the employment of species distribution modelling approaches are given, together with a guideline for appropriate usage. We close with challenges for future development of process-explicit species distribution models and how they may complement current approaches to study species distributions.},

Relative species richness peaked in areas where sea surface temperature averaged between 15 and 20°C, and correlated positively with chlorophyll a, revealing the optimum conditions driving bottom-up trophic effects for seabirds.

Quantitative descriptions of the environmental variables with which organisms are associated are becoming common with the advent of geographic information systems (GIS). Although such descriptive approaches to the niche are useful for interpolating species distributions, they implicitly incorporate biotic interactions and therefore do not represent the fundamental niche. A mechanistic understanding of the fundamental niche, when combined with GIS data, can provide us with greater insight into the causes of distribution and abundance, a solid foundation for exploring the role of biotic interactions, and greater confidence in extrapolating to novel circumstances such as climate change and species introductions. We apply such a mechanistic approach to study the climatic component of the fundamental niche of a nocturnal lizard, Heteronotia binoei, across an entire continent. We combine physiological measurements of this species (thermal requirements for egg development, thermal preferences and tolerances, metabolic and evaporative water loss rates), and high-resolution climatic data for the Australian continent (air temperature, cloud cover, wind speed, humidity, and radiation), with biophysical models to calculate the climatic component of the fundamental niche of this lizard and map it onto the Australian landscape at high resolution. We also use this approach to predict the effects of a mild global warming on the degree-days in the soil for egg development and the potential for aboveground activity of the study organism.},

The park is resident to 1 of only 3 gray seal colonies in France. The at-sea habitat use of gray seals in the marine park is poorly understood and direct interactions with human activities are expected. We investigated habitat selection of gray seals within the marine park to provide spatial planning recommendations to local conservation management. We obtained data from 19 seals tracked between 2010 and 2013. We used generalized linear models to investigate their habitat selection using distance to haulout, distance to shore, bathymetry, tidal current, and sediment type as explanatory variables. The tracked individuals spent 67{\%} of their time within the boundaries of the marine park. We investigated return trips to focus on habitat selection within the Iroise Sea. The deviance explained by the final model was 76{\%}. Distance to haulout explained 47{\%} of the deviance (seals selected short distances), bathymetry explained 40{\%} (with bimodal selection for waters shallower than 50 m or deeper than 150 m), distance to shore explained 6{\%} (selected distances less than 40 km), current explained 5{\%} (selected weak currents), and sediment explained 2{\%} (selected rocky areas). Habitat selection was concentrated in shallow waters located in the main archipelago of the marine park. The map of selected habitat will help identify potential conflicts of space use between seals and human activities such as fishing and leisure activities.

  abstract      = {Heterogeneous usage of space by individual animals or animal populations is partly due to their preference for particular resources that are, themselves, heterogeneously distributed. When all points in the environment are equally accessible, a direct relationship between usage and preference can be assumed. However, when accessibility is restricted, spatial variations in usage can no longer be attributed entirely to preference. In such cases, it is necessary to control for the effects of accessibility on observed usage before conclusions about preference can be drawn. In this paper, I develop a modelling framework that treats the use of space by animals as a joint function of preference and accessibility. I specify a null version of the framework that assumes no preference and propose that its output can be used to control for the effect of accessibility on the observed, spatial distribution of usage. I briefly discuss how the framework can subsequently be used to provide insights about the animals preference for different resources and types of movement, and to predict usage in areas where no usage data exist. I explore the properties of the methodology using data from a population of simulated animals and present the first results of its application to a sub-set of the British population of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus).},

  abstract      = {Habitat models are fundamental tools for designing evidence-based conservation measures, particularly for locating sites with high potential for promoting a species' recolonisation and occupancy. However, it remains challenging to respond to both the need for large-scale general rules, and for fine-scale information concurrently. Multi-level habitat models provide all-in-one surfaces that explicitly account for conditional dependencies among single-level selection probabilities. We integrated occurrence data obtained from citizen-science species observation data with radio-tracking data to develop multi-level resource selection functions for the little owl (Athene noctua), a species of conservation concern in Central Europe. The results of our habitat selection analyses confirmed that suitable little owl habitat is located in widely open agricultural landscapes that often exist in the vicinity of human settlements. We mapped habitats at fine resolution (40 × 40 m) over an area covering 77,313 km2in Switzerland and Baden-W{\"{u}}rttemberg, Germany. We validated the models with external out-of-sample data, and we demonstrated good predictive ability and transferability over the broad landscape. Overall, a fifth of the modelled landscape was estimated to be suitable for little owls. Habitat suitability scores in Switzerland were generally lower than in Baden-W{\"{u}}rttemberg due to higher elevation, fewer orchards, and more forest patches. Extant populations currently occupy c. 15{\%} of the potential suitable habitats in Baden-W{\"{u}}rttemberg, and 2{\%} in Switzerland, suggesting that considerable space for recolonisation is available. However, while Baden-W{\"{u}}rttemberg offers vast open landscapes, lowlands in Switzerland show narrow swaths of habitat along valleys and lakes. We showed that the simultaneous integration of different levels of habitat selection behaviour into a multi-level habitat suitability map creates a promising tool for conservation planning of endangered species over large geographical areas. Our multi-level model allowed for identification of both large-scale habitat suitability patterns to develop conservation strategies, and fine-scale clusters of high quality habitats where conservation measures can be applied at once, thereby increasing relevance of such all-in-one habitat maps for policy makers, wildlife managers and conservations practitioners alike.},

We illustrate our approach with 21 plant species in the French Alps.

We also show that incorporating abiotic, dispersal and biotic factors into the same model bring new insights to our understanding of community assembly. This approach, at the crossroads between community ecology and biogeography, is a promising avenue for a better understanding of species co-existence and biodiversity distribution.},

The validity of model projections, such as shifts in a species' climatic niche, becomes questionable particularly during extrapolations, such as for future no-analog climate conditions. To examine the effects of model complexity on SDM predictive performance, we fit statistical models of varying complexity to simulated species occurrence data arising from data-generating processes that assume differing degrees of distributional symmetry in environmental space, interaction effects, and coverage in climate space. Mismatches between data-generating processes and statistical models (i.e., different functional forms) led to poor predictive performance when extrapolating to new climate-space and greater variation in extrapolated predictions for overly complex models. In contrast, performance issues were not apparent when using independent evaluation data from the training region. These results draw into question the use of highly flexible models for prediction without ecological justification.},

We investigated whether patterns of distribution and resource use by free-ranging bison (Bison bison) in Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan, follow rules of energy maximization that hold across multiple scales. Optimality theory predicts specialization on Carex atherodes and frequency-independent selection among plant species; that is, local variation in C. atherodes biomass should not influence diet choice but only the time spent in individual patches. The summer use of resources within meadows was closely related to energy maximization principles. C. atherodes dominated the diet of bison, was selected in all meadows, and diet choice was frequency-independent among meadows in the bison range. In winter, diet was still dominated by C. atherodes, but frequency-dependent selection of Scolochloa festucacea and the relative use of Cirsium arvense were inconsistent with theoretical predictions. At a larger spatial scale, however, the probability of meadow use was not positively related to the abundance of Carex atherodes. During summer and winter, general landscape features within the daily radius of bison (2 km in summer and 1.3 km in winter), together with abiotic characteristics of meadows, had the major influence on the probability of meadow utilization. Our study suggests that bison distribution and resource use are influenced by abiotic and biotic factors which vary in importance at different spatio-temporal scales.},

  abstract      = {Detailed empirical models predicting both species occurrence and fitness across a landscape are necessary to understand processes related to population persistence. Failure to consider both occurrence and fitness may result in incorrect assessments of habitat importance leading to inappropriate management strategies. We took a two-stage approach to identifying critical nesting and brood-rearing habitat for the endangered Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in Alberta at a landscape scale. First, we used logistic regression to develop spatial models predicting the relative probability of use (occurrence) for Sage- Grouse nests and broods. Secondly, we used Cox proportional hazards survival models to identify the most risky habitats across the landscape. We combined these two approaches to identify Sage-Grouse habitats that pose minimal risk of failure (source habitats) and attractive sink habitats that pose increased risk (ecological traps). Our models showed that Sage-Grouse select for heterogeneous patches of moderate sagebrush cover (quadratic relationship) and avoid anthropogenic edge habitat for nesting. Nests were more successful in heterogeneous habitats, but nest success was independent of anthropogenic features. Similarly, broods selected heterogeneous high-productivity habitats with sagebrush while avoiding human developments, cultivated cropland, and high densities of oil wells. Chick mortalities tended to occur in proximity to oil and gas developments and along riparian habitats. For nests and broods, respectively, approximately 10{\%} and 5{\%} of the study area was considered source habitat, whereas 19{\%} and 15{\%} of habitat was attractive sink habitat. Limited source habitats appear to be the main reason for poor nest success (39{\%}) and low chick survival (12{\%}). Our habitat models identify areas of protection priority and areas that require immediate management attention to enhance recruitment to secure the viability of this population. This novel approach to habitat-based population viability modeling has merit for many species of concern.},

The selection of such localities may influence model parameterization and thus, can influence the appropriateness and accuracy of the model prediction when extrapolating the species distribution across time and space. We used 12 species from the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT) to evaluate the relationship between the geographic extent from which pseudo-absences are taken and model performance, and shape and importance of predictor variables using the MAXENT modeling method. Model performance is lower when pseudo-absence points are taken from either a restricted or broad region with respect to species occurrence data than from an intermediate region. Furthermore, variable importance (i.e., contribution to the model) changed such that, models became increasingly simplified, dominated by just two variables, as the area from which pseudo-absence points were drawn increased. Our results suggest that it is important to consider the spatial extent from which pseudo-absence data are taken. We suggest species distribution modeling exercises should begin with exploratory analyses evaluating what extent might provide both the most accurate results and biologically meaningful fit between species occurrence and predictor variables. This is especially important when modeling across space or time-a growing application for species distributional modeling. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {Conserving animals beyond protected areas is critical because even the largest reserves may be too small to maintain viable populations for many wide-ranging species. Identification of landscape features that will promote persistence of a diverse array of species is a high priority, particularly, for protected areas that reside in regions of otherwise extensive habitat loss. This is the case for Emas National Park, a small but important protected area located in the Brazilian Cerrado, the world's most biologically diverse savanna. Emas Park is a large-mammal global conservation priority area but is too small to protect wide-ranging mammals for the long-term and conserving these populations will depend on the landscape surrounding the park. We employed novel, noninvasive methods to determine the relative importance of resources found within the park, as well as identify landscape features that promote persistence of wide-ranging mammals outside reserve borders. We used scat detection dogs to survey for five large mammals of conservation concern: giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), jaguar (Panthera onca), and puma (Puma concolor). We estimated resource selection probability functions for each species from 1,572 scat locations and 434 giant armadillo burrow locations. Results indicate that giant armadillos and jaguars are highly selective of natural habitats, which makes both species sensitive to landscape change from agricultural development. Due to the high amount of such development outside of the Emas Park boundary, the park provides rare resource conditions that are particularly important for these two species. We also reveal that both woodland and forest vegetation remnants enable use of the agricultural landscape as a whole for maned wolves, pumas, and giant anteaters. We identify those features and their landscape compositions that should be prioritized for conservation, arguing that a multi-faceted approach is required to protect these species.},

  abstract      = {* Impediments to animal movement are ubiquitous and vary widely in both scale and permeability. It is essential to understand how impediments alter ecological dynamics via their influence on animal behavioural strategies governing space use and, for anthropogenic features such as roads and fences, how to mitigate these effects to effectively manage species and landscapes. * Here, we focused primarily on barriers to movement, which we define as features that cannot be circumnavigated but may be crossed. Responses to barriers will be influenced by the movement capabilities of the animal, its proximity to the barriers, and habitat preference. We developed a mechanistic modelling framework for simultaneously quantifying the permeability and proximity effects of barriers on habitat preference and movement. * We used simulations based on our model to demonstrate how parameters on movement, habitat preference and barrier permeability can be estimated statistically. We then applied the model to a case study of road effects on wild mountain reindeer summer movements. * This framework provided unbiased and precise parameter estimates across a range of strengths of preferences and barrier permeabilities. The quality of permeability estimates, however, was correlated with the number of times the barrier is crossed and the number of locations in proximity to barriers. In the case study we found that reindeer avoided areas near roads and that roads are semi-permeable barriers to movement. There was strong avoidance of roads extending up to c. 1 km for four of five animals, and having to cross roads reduced the probability of movement by 68{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (range 3{\textperiodcentered}5–99{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}). * Human infrastructure has embedded within it the idea of networks: nodes connected by linear features such as roads, rail tracks, pipelines, fences and cables, many of which divide the landscape and limit animal movement. The unintended but potentially profound consequences of infrastructure on animals remain poorly understood. The rigorous framework for simultaneously quantifying movement, habitat preference and barrier permeability developed here begins to address this knowledge gap.},

Our empirical example and simulations demonstrate how including random effects in resource selection models can aid interpretation and address difficult assumptions limiting their generality. This approach will allow researchers to appropriately estimate marginal (population) and conditional (individual) responses, and account for complex grouping, unbalanced sample designs and autocorrelation.

  abstract      = {The growing application of GPS telemetry in wildlife studies created need for analytical methods to meet both practical and theoretical concerns when conducting analyses of habitat or resource selection. We devised a new analysis approach of individual-based movement models for estimation of resource selection based on probability of use. We merged the Brownian bridge model of space use with the synoptic model of habitat selection to describe and estimate patterns of habitat selection from GPS telemetry data. In doing so, our approach implicitly defines availability based on movement data when conducting analysis of GPS telemetry data. To do so, we employed a step-by-step approach, based on sequential triplets of observations of the animals' movements. Availability was portrayed as a circular normal distribution at every middle GPS location, based on the existing Brownian bridge model of space use. This middle observation within the sequential triplet also reflected habitat selection, estimated by maximum likelihoods, based on the deviation from otherwise random movement between the first and third observations. This approach allowed each triplet across time to be treated as independent, identically distributed observations when estimating habitat selection. To demonstrate the utility of the model, we analyzed GPS location data collected from free-ranging mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) in the Cascade Mountains of the western United States to evaluate patterns of habitat selection while foraging during late spring and early summer. Slope of the terrain was the primary factor influencing resource selection by mountain goats in our study, with females selecting steeper areas closer to escape terrain than males. Finally, we derived a resource selection function applicable over a broad geographic extent to evaluate sites for potential release of mountain goats to augment the population in Washington, which has declined over the last 50 years. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract      = {Habitat selection is complex due to density dependence and functional responses, defi ned as variation in relative habitat use depending on availability. In this study we unite these concepts by empirically testing for density-dependent functional responses in habitat selection using a large herbivore, elk Cervus canadensis manitobensis , as a model species. Th eory on density-dependent habitat selection predicts specialised behaviour when densities are low with a gradual switch to generalist behaviour (more even selection of habitat) as competition intensifi es. Th is suggests that functional responses in habitat selection should be positive when competition is low, but that density may have a negative eff ect on the functional response due to constraining eff ects of competition on habitat use and availability. We tested this prediction using data from Global Positioning System (GPS) collared elk (n  33) and empirical data on spatiotemporal variation in local density during winter in Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, Canada (2002 – 2011). As local density increased, winter home range size decreased and the proportion of mixed forest (providing shelter and forage to elk) used and available within the home range also decreased. Our resource selection function (RSF) revealed clear density-dependent eff ects in selection, being strongest (or weakest) for high quality (or low quality) habitat types at lowest observed density leading to more even selection as densities increased. Th e functional response in mixed forest selection was negatively aff ected by local density. Increasing availability of mixed forest in the home range was associated with higher selection at low density (positive functional response); no eff ect of availability on selection at moderate density (no functional response); and lower selection as availability increased at high density (negative functional response). Our study demonstrates that this process is largely driven by the negative eff ect of density on home range size as it constrains use and availability of habitat.},

  abstract      = {Large carnivores are declining worldwide and few examples of successful reintroductions exist, because of their large home-ranges, low reproductive rates, and penchant for human-wildlife conflict that is the main cause of their decline. Moreover, few studies assess whether habitat suitability predicted before reintroduction, a critical evaluation step, matches post-reintroduction habitat selection. We examined habitat-related factors contributing to a successful brown bear (Ursus arctos) reintroduction in central Europe. Starting in 1999, 10 brown bears were translocated from Slovenia to Trentino in the Italian Alps, and this population has since grown by {\textgreater}10{\%}/year. First, we estimated multi-scale resource selection functions (RSF) with GPS collar data and validated models with k-folds cross validation and external VHF data. Then, we used Kappa-statistics to compare our population-scale RSF with a habitat suitability model (HSM) developed to predict potential habitat before reintroduction. Lastly, we employed least-cost path (LCP) analyses integrating our within home-range scale RSF to define movement paths. Overall, the HSM predicted post-reintroduction habitat selection well in many areas, but bears used orchards and shrubs more, and mixed/conifer forests and pastures less than expected prior to reintroduction. Finally, we identified road crossings of predicted paths between preferred habitat patches. We found two potential crossings in the Adige Valley, likely the biggest constraint for the study population to expand eastward and impeding dispersal to/from the closest bear population (Dinaric-Pindos population). Increasing awareness for key brown bear habitats and corridors, especially in potential ecological traps within cultural landscapes, will be necessary for large carnivore conservation.},

We analyzed the binary maps with the optimality method in order to identify areas of endemism and compare our results regarding previous analyses. The majority of the species tend to have very low values for the minimum training presence, whereas most of the species have a value of the tenth percentile training presence around 0.5, and the equal training sensitivity and specificity was around 0.3. Only with the tenth percentile threshold we recovered three out of the four patterns of endemism identified in North America, and detected more endemic species.The best identification of areas of endemism was obtained using the tenth percentile training presence threshold, which seems to recover better the distributional area of the mammals analyzed.

  abstract      = {Telemetry methods and remote sensing now make it possible to record the spatial usage of wide-ranging marine animals and the biophysical characteristics of their pelagic habitats. Furthermore, recent statistical advances mean such data can be used to test ecological hypotheses and estimate species' distributions. Black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophrys are highly mobile marine predators with a circumpolar breeding and foraging distribution in the southern hemisphere. Although they remain relatively abundant, increased fisheries bycatch has led to their listing as endangered by conservation bodies. We satellite-tracked 163 breeding black-browed albatrosses and eight closely-related Campbell albatrosses T. impavida from nine colonies. We then quantified habitat usage, and modeled population-level spatial distribution at spatiotemporal scales {\textgreater}50 km and 1 month, as a function of habitat accessibility, habitat preference and intra-specific competition, using mixed-effects Generalized Additive Models. During incubation, birds foraged over a wider area than in the post-brood chick-rearing period, when they are more time-constrained. Throughout breeding, the order of habitat preference of black-browed albatrosses was for neritic (0-500 m), shelf-break and upper shelf-slope (500 - 1000 m), and then oceanic ({\textgreater}1000 m) waters. Black-browed albatrosses also preferred areas with steeper ({\textgreater}3{degree sign}) bathymetric relief and in addition, during incubation, warmer sea surface temperatures (peak preference {\~{}}16{degree sign}). Although this suggests specialization in neritic habitats, incubation stage black-browed albatrosses from South Georgia also foraged extensively in oceanic waters, preferring areas with high Eddy Kinetic Energy ({\textgreater}250 cm2/s2), especially the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, a region of intense mesoscale turbulence. During chick-rearing this species, had a more southerly distribution, and following the seasonal retreat of sea ice birds from some populations utilized neritic polar waters. Campbell albatrosses showed similar bathymetric preferences but also preferred positive sea level anomalies. Black-browed albatross foraging areas were partially spatially segregated with respect to colony and region, with birds preferring locations distant from neighboring colonies, presumably in order to reduce competition between parapatric conspecifics. At the global scale, the greatest concentrations of breeding black-browed albatrosses are in southern South American neritic, shelf-break and shelf-slope waters. These regions also hold large fisheries and should therefore be a priority for introduction of bycatch mitigation measures.},

Unfortunately, there has been no basis for predicting niche dynamics over relevant timescales, from tens to a few hundreds of years. The recent application of species distribution models (SDMs) and phylogenetic methods to analysis of niche characteristics has provided insight to niche dynamics. Niche shifts and conservatism have both occurred within the last 100 years, with recent speciation events, and deep within clades of species. There is increasing evidence that coordinated application of these methods can help to identify species which likely fulfill one key assumption in the predictive application of SDMs: an unchanging niche. This will improve confidence in SDM-based predictions of the impacts of climate change and species invasions on species distributions and biodiversity.*These authors contributed equally. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract      = {A recent shift in conservation policy from the site scale to the ecosystem or landscape scale requires underpinning by large-scale species distribution data. This poses a significant challenge in conserving small/less charismatic species (SLCS's) whose often cryptic nature can result in spatially restricted sampling, thus preventing landscape scale conservation projects from being realised for these ecologically important groups. Species distribution models (SDMs) can provide a powerful tool to bridge this gap. However, in the case of SLCS's (here lichen epiphytes in temperate rainforests of western Scotland are used as a model system), direct predictor variables exist at micro-scales (millimetres to centimetres), which are not extensively available in landscape-scale datasets. Here we identify a group of well-mapped larger-scale ‘compound variables' which capture the effect of multiple direct predictors (such as bark pH and topography), and test whether they can be successfully used to predict species distributions at the landscape scale, circumventing the need for direct (micro-scale) predictor data. By testing the SDMs more widely within western Scotland, accurate predictions of species presence/absence could be made throughout the region for 5 of the 9 lichen epiphytes, making these SDMs extremely valuable as a conservation planning tool. Species distribution models utilising compound variables as predictors offer a solution to the paucity of species distributional data for SLCS's, and present a valuable resource in conservation planning for such species. The importance of testing the SDMs outside of a training region to prevent prediction error is highlighted however.},

  abstract      = {A resource selection function (RSF) is any model that yields values proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit. RSF models often are fitted using generalized linear models (GLMs) although a variety of statistical models might be used. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are tools that can be useful for selecting a model from a set of biologically plausible candidates. Statistical inference procedures, such as the likelihood-ratio test, can be used to assess whether models deviate from random null models. But for most applications of RSF models, usefulness is evaluated by how well the model predicts the location of organisms on a landscape. Predictions from RSF models constructed using presence/absence (used/unused) data can be evaluated using procedures developed for logistic regression, such as confusion matrices, Kappa statistics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. However, RSF models estimated from presence/available data create unique problems for evaluating model predictions. For presence/available models we propose a form of k-fold cross validation for evaluating prediction success. This involves calculating the correlation between RSF ranks and area-adjusted frequencies for a withheld sub-sample of data. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate predictive success for out-of-sample data. Not all RSF models are robust for application in different times or different places due to ecological and behavioral variation of the target organisms. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract      = {Species distribution modeling is one of the most effective habitat analysis methods for wildlife conservation. We evaluated the sensitivity of species distribution modeling to different grain sizes and extent sizes from 30m to 4950m using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling. The grain size represents a unit for analysis, whereas the extent size defines the scope of the analysis in a way that reflects the environmental data for the area in which the species of interest occurs. We compared the resulting suitability indexes and habitat areas based on two approaches. The first approach increases the extent size for a fixed grain size. The second approach increases the grain size and the extent size by equal amounts. The suitability index based on the first approach (R2=0.34) was greater than the suitability index based on the second approach (R2=0.89). The first approach was fitted to a logarithmic function with a critical point at approximately 0.5km, converging to about 0.76. In contrast, the second approach showed a linear decrease to values less than 0.5. The distribution of habitat area found with the second method (R2=0.87) was broader than that found with the first method (R2=0.63). The relationship between the extent size and the landscape index of the first method can be displayed as a power-law graph with a critical point of 0.5km. The method of expanding extent size has greater accuracy, although the time that it requires for data processing is long. The results of this study suggest that the maximum grain size should be approximately 1.5km. If the grain size is greater than 1.5km, the accuracy of the habitat suitability index decreases below 0.6, and the predicted habitat suitability increases dramatically. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract      = {Predictive species distribution models are standard tools in ecological research and are used to address a variety of applied and conservation related issues. When making temporal or spatial predictions, uncertainty is inevitable and prediction errors may depend not only on data quality and the modelling algorithm used, but on species characteristics. Here, we applied a standard distribution modelling technique (generalized linear models) using European plant species distribution data and climatic parameters. Predictive performance was calculated using AUC, (Cohen's) Kappa and true skill statistic (TSS), that were subsequently correlated with biological and life-history traits. After accounting for phylogenetic dependence among species, model performance was poorest for species having a short life span and occurring in human disturbed habitats. Our results clearly indicate that the performance of distribution models can be dependent on functional traits and provide further evidence that a species' ecology is likely to affect the ability of models to predict its distribution. Biased and less reliable predictions could misguide policy decisions and the management and conservation of our natural heritage. {\textcopyright} 2010 R{\"{u}}bel Foundation, ETH Z{\"{u}}rich.},

  abstract      = {Deterministic spatial interpolation algorithms such as the natural neighbor interpolation (NNI) or the Cressman interpolation schemes are widely used to interpolate environmental features. In particular, the former have been applied to digital elevation models (DEM's), the latter to weather data and pollutant exposure. However, they are unsatisfying in that they fail to provide any uncertainty assessment. Such schemes are not model-based; rather, they provide a set of rules, usually geometrically motivated, by which point-level data is interpolated to a grid. We distinguish this setting from the case where the deterministic model is essentially a mapping from inputs to outputs in which case a joint model can be formulated to assign uncertainty. In our setting we have no inputs, only an interpolated surface at some spatial resolution.We propose a general approach to handle the non model-based setting. In fact, the approach can be used to assign uncertainty to any supplied surface regardless of how it was created. We first formulate a useful notion of uncertainty and then show, with additional external validation data, that we can attach uncertainty using a convenient version of a data fusion model. We also clarify the distinction between this setting and the more usual case where we are trying to build an explanatory model to explain an environmental surface.We discuss two settings for such interpolation, one where the surface is presumed to be continuous such as elevation or temperature and the other where the surface would be discontinuous such as with precipitation where, at any location, there would be a point mass in the distribution at 0. We work within a hierarchical Bayesian framework and illustrate with a DEM within the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

  abstract      = {Animals selecting habitats often have to consider many factors, e.g., food and cover for safety. However, each habitat type often lacks an adequate mixture of these factors. Analyses of habitat selection using resource selection functions (RSFs) for animal radiotelemetry data typically ignore trade-offs, and the fact that these may change during an animal's daily foraging and resting rhythm on a short-term basis. This may lead to changes in the relative use of habitat types if availability differs among individual home ranges, called functional responses in habitat selection. Here, we identify such functional responses and their underlying behavioral mechanisms by estimating RSFs through mixed-effects logistic regression of telemetry data on 62 female red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Norway. Habitat selection changed with time of day and activity, suggesting a trade-off in habitat selection related to forage quantity or quality vs. shelter. Red deer frequently used pastures offering abundant forage and little canopy cover during nighttime when actively foraging, while spending much of their time in forested habitats with less forage but more cover during daytime when they are more often inactive. Selection for pastures was higher when availability was low and decreased with increasing availability. Moreover, we show for the first time that in the real world with forest habitats also containing some forage, there was both increasing selection of pastures (i.e., not proportional use) and reduced time spent in pastures (i.e., not constant time use) with lowered availability of pastures within the home range. Our study demonstrates that landscape-level habitat composition modifies the trade-off between food and cover for large herbivorous mammals. Consequently, landscapes are likely to differ in their vulnerability to crop damage and threat to biodiversity from grazing.},

However, users often underestimate the strong links between data type, model output and suitability for end-use. We synthesize current knowledge and provide a simple framework that summarizes how interactions between data type and the sampling process (i.e. imperfect detection and sampling bias) determine the quantity that is estimated by a SDM. We then draw upon the published literature and simulations to illustrate and evaluate the information needs of the most common ecological, biogeographical and conservation applications of SDM outputs. We find that, while predictions of models fitted to the most commonly available observational data (presence records) suffice for some applications, others require estimates of occurrence probabilities, which are unattainable without reliable absence records. Our literature review and simulations reveal that, while converting continuous SDM outputs into categories of assumed presence or absence is common practice, it is seldom clearly justified by the application's objective and it usually degrades inference. Matching SDMs to the needs of particular applications is critical to avoid poor scientific inference and management outcomes. This paper aims to help modellers and users assess whether their intended SDM outputs are indeed fit for purpose.},

  abstract      = {Statistical models of habitat preference and species distribution (e.g., Resource Selection Functions and Maximum Entropy approaches) perform a quantitative comparison of the use of space with the availability of all habitats in an animal's environment. However, not all of space is accessible all of the time to all individuals, so availability is in fact determined by limitations in animal perception and mobility. Therefore, measuring habitat availability at biologically relevant scales is essential for understanding preference, but herein lies a trade-off: Models fitted at large spatial scales, will tend to average across the responses of different individuals that happen to be in regions with contrasting habitat compositions. We suggest that such models may fail to capture local extremes (hotspots and coldspots) in animal usage and call this potential problem, homogenization. In contrast, models fitted at smaller scales will vary stochastically depending on the particular habitat composition of their narrow spatial neighborhood, and hence fail to describe responses when predicting for different sampling instances. This is the now well-documented issue of non-transferability of habitat models. We illustrate this tradeoff, using a range of simulated experiments, incorporating variations in environmental gradients, richness and fragmentation. We propose diagnostics for detecting the two issues of homogenization and non-transferability and show that these scale-related symptoms are likely to be more pronounced in highly fragmented or steeply graded landscapes. Further, we address these problems by treating the neighborhood of each cell in the landscape grid as an individual sampling instance (with its own neighborhood), hence allowing coefficients to respond to the local expectations of environmental variables according to a Generalized Functional Response (GFR). Under simulation this approach is consistently better at estimating robust (i.e., transferable) habitat models at smaller scales, and less susceptible to homogenization at larger scales. At the same time, it represents the first application of a GFR to continuous space (rather than multiple, spatially distinct datasets), allowing the predictive advantages of this extension of species distribution models to become available to data from large-scale but single-site field studies.},
